DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     CCddcccc is used to clear, control, and query the control file used by Dis-
     tributed Checksum Clearinghouse clients such as dccm(8).  The host names,
     UDP port numbers, IDs, and passwords local clients use to talk to servers
     as well as IP addresses, round trip times, and other information are con-
     tained in the _m_a_p file.  While ccddcccc is set-UID, it uses the real UID only
     when accessing the _m_a_p file.  It refuses to display sensitive information
     such as passwords unless the real UID is the same as the effective UID.
     Note that ccddcccc needs to be set to a UID that can read and write the _m_a_p
     file, but that UID need not be 0.

     CCddcccc is also used to send commands to DCC servers to tell them to stop,
     reload their lists of DCC IDs, turn on tracing, and so forth.

     Many commands sent to DCC servers require a numeric DCC ID and a password
     recognized by the server.  A DCC password is a 1-32 character string that
     does not contain blank, tab, newline or carriage return characters.  The
     ID is specified with the iidd operation.  If ccddcccc is run with a real UID
     that can read the _i_d_s file and a password is not specified (see the
     ppaasssswwoorrdd operation), then the current password for the specified ID in
     the _i_d_s file will be used.  If no _i_d_s file is available and a password
     and DCC ID are not specified, ccddcccc uses the anonymous DCC client-ID.  DCC
     servers do not expect a password from clients using the anonymous client-
     ID, but they also won't honor control requests.

     Operations that modify the _m_a_p file can only be performed when the real
     UID is sufficient to modify the file directly.  Trying to perform an
     operation that requires a password without specifying a server-ID or
     without using a UID that can access the _i_d_s file produces an error mes-
     sage complaining about a "privileged operation."

     Commands and operations are read from the command line or from stdin.  A
     series of _o_p_1 _o_p_2 _._._. operations followed a _- (a dash) causes operations
     to be read from stdin after the command line operations are processed.
     Semi-colons or newlines separate commands in UNIX command-line "words,"
     as well as when commands are read from stdin.  Since each command line
     operation must be a shell "word," quotes are often required as in

           % cdcc "load map.txt"
     or

           % cdcc "host localhost;info" stats

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following options are available:

     --VV   displays the version of the DCC controller.  Two or more --VV options
          show the options with which it was built.

     --BB   sends error messages from the DCC server to both stderr and stdout
          instead of only stderr.

     --dd   enables debugging output from the DCC client software.  Additional
          --dd options increase the number of messages.  See the ddeebbuugg command.

     --qq   quiets initial complaints about the map file and some messages about
          successful commands.  See the qquuiieett command.

     --hh _h_o_m_e_d_i_r
          overrides the default DCC home directory, _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c.  See the hhoommeeddiirr
          operation.

     --cc _i_d_s
          specifies the file containing DCC IDs and passwords known by local
          DCC servers.  An _i_d_s file that can be read by others cannot be used.
          The format of the _i_d_s file is described in dccd(8).

     _o_p_1 _o_p_2 _._._.
          are operations or commands such as "id 100; stop".  Commands or
          operations specified on the command line are performed before the
          first interactive request.  The last command can be _- to specify
          that additional commands should be read from stdin.

   OOPPEERRAATTIIOONNSS
     Local operations include the following:

     hheellpp [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
           lists information about one or all available commands and opera-
           tions.

     eexxiitt  stops ccddcccc

     ggrreeyy [_o_n | _o_f_f]
           switches between DCC and greylist servers.

     hhoommeeddiirr [_p_a_t_h]
           displays or specifies the DCC home directory, _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c.

     ffiillee [_m_a_p]
           displays or specifies the name or path of the map file.  The string
           "-" specifies the default file _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c_/_m_a_p.

     nneeww mmaapp [_m_a_p]
           creates a new, empty file for DCC server host names, port numbers,
           passwords, and so forth.  There must not already be a file of the
           same name.  The default is _m_a_p in the DCC home directory.

     ddeelleettee _h_o_s_t[,_p_o_r_t]
           deletes the entry in the _m_a_p file for _h_o_s_t and UDP _p_o_r_t_. If
           greylist mode has been set with the ggrreeyy oonn command, the entry for
           the grelist server at _h_o_s_t is deleted.

     aadddd _h_o_s_t[,_p_o_r_t] [_R_T_T_+_a_d_j|_R_T_T_-_a_d_j] [_G_r_e_y_l_i_s_t] [_c_l_i_e_n_t_-_I_D [password]]
           adds an entry to the _m_a_p file.  The _p_o_r_t can be "-" to specify the
           default DCC server port number.

           An adjustment to the round trip time is between -2000 and +2000 and
           follows the string _R_T_T.  The adjustment is added to the average
           measured round trip time when the DCC client software picks the
           "nearest" DCC server, or the server with the smallest RTT.  If an
           IP address is mentioned more than once in the list of servers, for
           example because it is among the addresses for more than one server
           name, conflicts among RTT adjustments are resolved by picking the
           adjustment with the largest absolute value.

           _G_r_e_y_l_i_s_t marks an entry for a greylist servers.  _G_r_e_y_l_i_s_t is
           assumed if greylist mode has been set with the ggrreeyy oonn command, See
           dccd(8).

           If both the client-ID and the password are absent, the anonymous
           client-ID, 1, is used.  The string _a_n_o_n is equivalent to the anony-
           mous client-ID.  A null password string is assumed if the password
           is missing and the client-ID is 1 or also missing.

     llooaadd _i_n_f_o_-_f_i_l_e
           loads the current parameter file with the host names, port numbers,
           IDs, and passwords in _i_n_f_o_-_f_i_l_e.  Standard input is understood if
           _i_n_f_o_-_f_i_l_e is "-".

           A suitable file can be created with the iinnffoo operation.  It con-
           sists of ignored blank or comment lines starting with '#' and other
           lines in the same format as the arguments to the aadddd operation.
           Note that output of the iinnffoo command will lack passwords unless it
           is run by a privileged user.

     hhoosstt [_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e]
           specifies the host name of the DCC server to which commands should
           be sent.  If _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e is "-", the current default DCC server is
           chosen.

     ppoorrtt [_p_o_r_t]
           specifies the UDP port number of the DCC server to which commands
           should be sent.  The default is 6277 or 6276 depending on the set-
           ting of the greylist mode controlled with the ggrreeyy command.

     ppaasssswwoorrdd _s_e_c_r_e_t
           specifies the password with which to sign commands sent to the DCC
           server specified with the sseerrvveerr and ppoorrtt operations.

     iidd [_I_D]
           specifies or displays the numeric DCC ID for commands sent to the
           DCC server specified with the sseerrvveerr and ppoorrtt operations.  If no
           password is specified with the ppaasssswwoorrdd command, the password is
           sought in the local _i_d_s.

     iinnffoo [--NN]
           displays information about the connections to DCC servers.  It
           starts with the current date and name of the current _m_a_p file or
           says that ccddcccc is using the implicit file created with the sseerrvveerr
           and ppoorrtt operations.  It then says when host names will next be
           resolved into IP addresses, the smallest round trip time to the IP
           addresses of known DCC servers.  The host name, UDP port number (or
           dash if it is the default), DCC client-ID, and password (if ccddcccc is
           used by a privileged user) are shown in one line per configured DCC
           server.

           The currently preferred IP address is indicated by an asterisk.
           The "brand" of the server, its DCC ID, and its IP address are dis-
           played in one line per IP address.  The performance of the server
           at each IP address in the most recent 32 operations is displayed in
           a second line.  The second line ends with the measured delay
           imposed by the server on requests with this client's ID.

           --NN displays the reverse DNS name of each server.

     RRTTTT [--NN]
           measures the round trip time to the DCC servers.  It does this by
           discarding accumulated information and forcing a probe of all
           listed server IP addresses.

           _B_e_w_a_r_e that when run with sufficient privilege, the RRTTTT operation
           is like the iinnffoo and llooaadd operations and displays cleartext pass-
           words.

           --NN displays the reverse DNS name of each server.

     ddeebbuugg Op Ar on | off | TTL=x
           increases or decreases debugging information from the DCC client
           software or sets the IP TTL on queries to the server.  See --dd.

           Some operating systems do not include the functions required to
           change the IP TTL.  Others include the required functions but have
           no apparent effect.

     qquuiieett [_o_n | _o_f_f]
           makes commands more quiet or more verbose.

     IIPPvv66 [_o_n | _o_f_f | _o_n_l_y]
           clients to try to use IPv6 and IPv4, IPv4 only, or IPv6 only.

     SSOOCCKKSS [_o_n | _o_f_f]
           tell DCC to use the SOCKS5 protocol if they have been built with a
           SOCKS library.  The socks library linked with the DCC client must
           be configured appropriately, often including knowing which DCC
           servers must be connected via the SOCKS proxy and which can be
           reached directly.  DCC clients use SOCKS functions such as
           Rsendto() with all or no servers depending on the setting of this
           switch.

     ssrrcc [_- |] _I_P_a_d_d_r_e_s_s[_,_I_P_v_6_a_d_d_r_e_s_s]
           displays or configures the source address of DCC client requests.
           _- removes the explicit configuration of the source, while _I_P_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
           or _I_P_a_d_d_r_e_s_s_,_I_P_v_6_a_d_d_r_e_s_s sets it.  This makes sense only on multi-
           homed hosts.  It can be useful for passing firewalls.

   DDCCCC SSEERRVVEERR CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     Commands that can be sent to a DCC server include the following.  Most of
     the commands must be used with the server's _I_D specified with the iidd com-
     mand.  The specified ID is included in the commands sent to the server
     The command itself is digitally signed with the first password associated
     with the ID in the _i_d_s file.  The server requires that the signature
     match one of the passwords associated with the ID in its _i_d_s file.

     ddeellcckk ttyyppee hheexx11 hheexx22 hheexx33 hheexx44
          asks the server to delete the _t_y_p_e checksum with value _h_e_x_1 _h_e_x_2
          _h_e_x_3 _h_e_x_4.  The type and checksum values can be found in dccproc(8)
          and dccm(8) log files or computed with _d_c_c_p_r_o_c --QQCC.

          There are very few situations where it makes sense to bother to
          delete checksums.  For example, mail that was accidentally reported
          with a target count of "MANY" is either private and so will not be
          seen by other people and so will not be affected, or it is bulk and
          its source so must have already been whitelisted by recipients.

     ssttaattss [_a_l_l | _c_l_e_a_r]
          displays current status and statistics from the current DCC server
          or for _a_l_l known DCC servers.  The server's counters will be cleared
          after they are displayed when the server's ID has been specified
          with the iidd _I_D operation.

     cclliieennttss [--nnssiiaaVVAAKK] [--II _i_d] [_m_a_x [_t_h_o_l_d]] [_a_d_d_r[_/_p_r_e_f_i_x]]
          display some of the clients recently seen by the server.
          --nn     display only the IP addresses and not the names of clients.
          --ss     sort the clients by the number of requests they have made.
          --ii     count clients with the same client-ID as single entities.
          --II _i_d  display information only about clients using client-ID _i_d.
          --aa     produce 24 hour average numbers of requests.
          --AA     display only anonymous clients.
          --KK     display only clients using client-IDs other than the anony-
                 mous ID of 1.
          --VV     include the DCC protocol versions used by clients.
          _m_a_x    display only the _m_a_x most recent clients.
          _m_a_x _t_h_o_l_d display the most recent _m_a_x clients that have made at
                 least _t_h_o_l_d requests.
          _a_d_d_r[_/_p_r_e_f_i_x] restricts the results to the DCC client with that IP
                 address or clients with addresses in that block of addresses.
                 Individual clients in a blacklisted block of addresses in the
                 server's _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c_/_b_l_a_c_k_l_i_s_t file are not displayed unless
                 explicitly requested by address or address block.

          Clients with IDs marked with an asterisk (*) used the wrong password
          for that client-ID.

          The mechanism that implements this command involves asking the DCC
          server for the first approximately 100 clients, then the second
          about 100, and so on, If entries change position in the complete
          list maintained by the server between requests, the displayed list
          will have duplicate or missing entries.  Only clients since the last
          use of ssttaattss cclleeaarr are displayed.

     ssttoopp
          tells the DCC server to exit.

     ssyysstteemm ssttoopp
          tells the DCC server to exit so that the operating system can be
          shut down.  This tells the DCC server on some systems to delete the
          dcc_db.hash file to speed system shut down.  The file will be
          rebuilt automatically by ddbbcclleeaann when the DCC server is restarted.

     cclleeaann ssttoopp
          tells the DCC server to exit after applying fsync() to the database.

     rreellooaadd IIDDss
          tells the local DCC server to reload its DCC _i_d_s file immediately.
          This command is not strictly needed.  Every several minutes, the DCC
          server notices if the file has been changed and automatically reads
          it.

     fflloooodd cchheecckk
          tells the DCC server to check for changes in the _f_l_o_d file and try
          to restart any of the streams to peers that are broken.

     fflloooodd sshhuuttddoowwnn
          tells the DCC server to cleanly stop flooding checksums to and from
          peers.  The server will wait for sending and receiving peers to
          agree to stop.  Each fflloooodd sshhuuttddoowwnn or fflloooodd hhaalltt request increases
          a count of reasons why the server should not flood checksums.

     fflloooodd hhaalltt
          tells the DCC server to abruptly stop flooding checksums to and from
          peers.

     fflloooodd rreewwiinndd _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_I_D
          tells the DCC server to ask its peer with _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_I_D to rewind and
          resend its stream of checksums.

     fflloooodd ffffwwdd iinn _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_I_D
          tells the DCC server to ask its peer to "fast forward" or skip to
          the end of the incoming flood.

     fflloooodd ffffwwdd oouutt _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_I_D
          tells the DCC server to "fast forward" or skip to the current end of
          the flood to its peer.

     fflloooodd rreessuummee
          tells the DCC server to reduce the number of reasons to not flood
          checksums increased by fflloooodd sshhuuttddoowwnn and fflloooodd hhaalltt.. When the num-
          ber of reasons reaches zero, the server tries to resume flooding.

     fflloooodd lliisstt
          displays the list of current incoming and outgoing floods.  Each
          line contains the server-ID of the peer, the IP address and port
          used for the outgoing flood, the address for the incoming flood if
          different, and the host name.  Only the server-IDs of flooding peers
          are disclosed with the server's ID.

     fflloooodd ssttaattss [cclleeaarr] { _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_I_D | _a_l_l }
          displays counts of checksum reports sent and received by the current
          flooding connections to and from _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_I_D or _a_l_l flooding connec-
          tions and then optionally clears the counts.

     DDBB cclleeaann
          is used by ddbbcclleeaann to tell the server that the database expiration
          has begun.

     DDBB nneeww
          is used by ddbbcclleeaann to tell the server that the database cleaning is
          complete.

     fflluusshh ccaacchhee
          tells the server to flush its cache and to keep it clean.

     ccaacchhee ookk
          tells the server to resume normal operations after fflluusshh ccaacchhee.

     cclloocckk cchheecckk
          asks the DCC server to say how much its clock differs from the local
          clock.

     cclloocckk kklluuddggee ++//--sseeccoonnddss
          adjusts the timestamps in server commands to make it possible to
          control servers with inaccurate clocks.

     ttrraaccee _d_e_f_a_u_l_t
          turns on _A_N_O_N and _C_L_N_T tracing and turns off all others.

     ttrraaccee _m_o_d_e _{_o_n_|_o_f_f_}
          turns the server's tracing _m_o_d_e on or off.  _M_o_d_e must be one of:
            _A_D_M_N    administrative requests from ccddcccc
            _A_N_O_N    errors by anonymous clients
            _C_L_N_T    errors by authenticated clients
            _R_L_I_M    rate-limited messages
            _Q_U_E_R_Y   all queries and reports
            _R_I_D_C    messages concerning the report-ID cache that is used to
                    detect duplicate reports from clients
            _F_L_O_O_D_1  messages about inter-server flooding connections
            _F_L_O_O_D_2  messages about flooded reports
            _I_D_S     unknown server-IDs in flooded reports
            _B_L      blacklisted clients
            _D_B      odd database events
            _W_L_I_S_T   reports of whitelisted checksums from authenticated, not
                    anonymous DCC clients

     ccddcccc exits with 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs in operations
     specified on the command line.
