.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Dbclean
creates empty, rebuilds corrupted, and deletes or expires old reports
of checksums from DCC databases.
It should be installed where it will be found with the path
given the DCC server daemon when the daemon needs to expand the hash table.
See
.Xr dccd 8 .
It should also be run by the daily
.Xr cron 8
job,
.Pa @libexecdir@/cron-dccd .
.Pp
The whitelist in
.Pa @prefix@/whitelist
or
.Pa @prefix@/grey_whitelist
are built into the DCC server's database.
Changes to the whitelist are not effective until dbclean is run.
White or blacklists can also be used by DCC clients and work better.
.Ss OPTIONS
The following options are available.
Most of them should set by changing DBCLEAN_LOGDAYS
and DBCLEAN_ARGS in the
.Pa @prefix@/dcc_conf
control file.
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl d
enables debugging output.
Additional
.Fl d
options increase the number of messages.
.It Fl F
uses write() instead of mmap() and msync() in some cases to modify the DCC
database.
This works better on some versions of Solaris provided the entire DCC
database fits in RAM and provided the file system has not been tuned
for the large, random accesses of a DCC database.
It is the default on Solaris except when the database is in a memory
mapped file system or the entire database fits in RAM.
Do not use
.Fl F
with
.Fl f ,
.Fl H ,
or
.Fl D .
.It Fl f
uses mmap() and msync() to modify the DCC database.
Do not use
.Fl f
with
.Fl F ,
.Fl H ,
or
.Fl D .
.It Fl N
creates a new, empty database.
There must not be an existing database and the DCC server,
.Xr dccd 8 ,
must not be running.
.It Fl P
expires old checksums from a database using the
.Fl e and
.Fl E
values from the preceding use of
.Nm dbclean .
.Fl P
cannot be used with
.Fl e
or
.Fl E .
Using
.Fl P
differs from not using
.Fl e
or
.Fl E ,
because in the absence of all three, their default values are used.
.It Fl S
says that
the DCC server,
.Xr dccd 8 ,
is not running and so
.Nm
should run stand-alone and not try to tell the DCC server about
changes to the database.
.Fl i
is not needed with
.Fl S .
.It Fl V
displays the version of the DCC database cleaner.
Two or more
.Fl V
options show the options with which it was built.
.It Fl q
quiets the announcement to stderr of the final results and debugging
messages turned on with
.Fl d .
Results are still sent to the system log.
.It Fl u
should be used when the file system containing the
.Pa dcc_db
and
.Pa dcc_db.hash
files is "ultra-fast," such as a solid-state drive.
This setting postpones writing some data during normal operation until the
system is shutdown.
This reduces wear on the SSD at the cost of writing GBytes of
data when the system is shutdown.
Writing GBytes to a rotating disk at system shutdown unacceptable,
but not noticeable to a non-rotating disk that operates 10 or 100 times
faster.
.It Fl i Ar id
specifies the DCC ID recognized by the local DCC server as its own.
This ID allows the DCC server to recognize commands from
.Nm
to stop using the database while it is being cleaned.
.It Fl a Xo
.Sm off
.Op Ar server-addr
.Op Ar ,port
.Xc
.Sm on
is commonly used to specify a UDP port or IP address of the local
server other than the default.
.It Fl h Ar homedir
overrides the default DCC home directory,
.Pa @prefix@ .
.It Fl H Ar hash-file-dir
puts the
.Pa dcc_db.hash
hash table file in the
.Ar hash-file-dir
directory with a symbolic link.
Using
.Fl H
to put the hash table in a memory, "tmpfs", or "swap" file system such as
.Pa /dev/shm
or
.Pa /tmp
significantly speeds up the DCC server,
.Xr dccd 8 ,
on operating systems such as Linux and Solaris that lack the
.Em MAP_NOSYNC
flag for the
.Xr mmap 8
system call.
.Pp
The memory file system must have space for two copies of the
.Pa dcc_db.hash
file.
.Fl H
is undesirable on FreeBSD and other systems with
.Em MAP_NOSYNC
except when
.Fl D
is used.
The DCC database file,
.Pa dcc_db ,
should usually be in file system that is not cleared by operating system
rebooting and
.Em not
in a memory file system.
.Pp
Use or stop using
.Fl H
by adding it to or removing it from DBCLEAN_ARGS in @prefix@/dcc_conf
and manually running or waiting for the nightly run of the
@libexecdir@/cron-dccd cron job.
.Pp
Do not use
.Fl H
with
.Fl F
or
.Fl f .
.It Fl D Ar db-file-dir
puts the
.Pa @prefix@/dcc_db
database
and the
.Pa @prefix@/dcc_db.hash
hash table files in the
.Ar db-file-dir
directory with symbolic links.
Using
.Fl D
to put the files in a memory, "tmpfs", or "swap" file system such as
.Pa /dev/shm
or
.Pa /tmp
significantly speeds up the DCC server,
.Xr dccd 8 ,
but causes several GBytes of database transfers before DCC is effective
whenever the operating system is restarted.
.Fl D
should
.Em not
be used except at sites with more than one DCC server installation
and where at least one of the other local servers is not using
.Fl D .
.Fl D
should only be used on systems that are rarely rebooted, because
up to one month is required for the database reach equilibrium.
.Pp
The memory file system must have space for two copies of the
.Pa dcc_db
file.
.Pp
Use or stop using
.Fl D
by adding it to or removing it from DBCLEAN_ARGS in @prefix@/dcc_conf
and manually running or waiting for the nightly run of the
@libexecdir@/cron-dccd cron job.
.Pp
Do not use
.Fl D
with
.Fl F
or
.Fl f .
.It Fl G Ar on
cleans a greylist database in
.Pa @prefix@/grey_db
and
.Pa @prefix@/grey_db.hash
instead of of a DCC server database.
.It Fl R Ar mode
repairs a database or does a quick cleaning.
.Ar Mode
must be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width quick -compact
.It Em bad
to repair a broken database.
.It Em quick
for a quick, superficial cleaning during the day.
.It Em hash
to rebuild a hash not sent to disk before the system was rebooted.
.It Em failsafe
to work around missing nightly cleaning by the
.Xr cron 8
job,
.Pa @libexecdir@/cron-dccd
.It Em del
to finish processing a delete command received by
.Xr dccd 8 .
.El
.It Fl s Ar hash-size
specifies a size for the hash table in
.Pa @prefix@/dcc_db.hash .
By default the hash table is rebuilt to be approximately 80% full based
on an estimate of the number of distinct checksums in the database file.
.It Fl e Ar seconds
specifies that reports older than
.Ar seconds
and with totals below 10 targets should be deleted.
Reports older than
.Ar seconds
of checksums that have been reported more recently
are summarized in the database.
The default value is 1DAY or the value of
.Fl E ,
whichever is smaller.
The 1 day default is reduced if the system does not appear to have
enough RAM to hold the database.
The minimum is 1 hour.
.Ar Seconds
can also be
.Ar NEVER
or a number of hours, days, or weeks followed by
.Ar HOURS ,
.Ar H ,
.Ar DAYS ,
.Ar D ,
.Ar WEEKS
or
.Ar W .
.Pp
DCC servers that are not very busy and are
isolated or do not receive "floods" of checksums
from busy servers should use longer values
to increase their chances of recognizing bulk mail.
.It Fl E Ar spamsecs
changes the expiration of checksums with more than 10 targets
from the default of 30DAYS or the explicit value of
.Fl e ,
whichever is larger.
The default is reduced if the system does not have enough RAM
to hold the database.
.Ar Spamsecs
can also be
.Ar NEVER
or a number of hours, days, or weeks followed by
.Ar HOURS ,
.Ar H ,
.Ar DAYS ,
.Ar D ,
.Ar WEEKS
or
.Ar W .
.It Fl L Ar ltype,facility.level
specifies how messages should be logged.
.Ar Ltype
must be
.Ar error ,
.Ar info ,
or
.Ar off
to indicate which of the two types of messages are being controlled or
to turn off all
.Xr syslog 3
messages from
.Nm .
.Ar Level
must be a
.Xr syslog 3
level among
.Ar EMERG ,
.Ar ALERT ,
.Ar CRIT , ERR ,
.Ar WARNING ,
.Ar NOTICE ,
.Ar INFO ,
and
.Ar DEBUG .
.Ar Facility
must be among
.Ar AUTH ,
.Ar AUTHPRIV ,
.Ar CRON ,
.Ar DAEMON ,
.Ar FTP ,
.Ar KERN ,
.Ar LPR ,
.Ar MAIL ,
.Ar NEWS ,
.Ar USER ,
.Ar UUCP ,
and
.Ar LOCAL0
through
.Ar LOCAL7 .
The default is equivalent to
.Dl Fl L Ar info,MAIL.NOTICE  Fl L Ar error,MAIL.ERR
.El
.Pp
.Nm
exits 0 on success,
and > 0 if an error occurs.
