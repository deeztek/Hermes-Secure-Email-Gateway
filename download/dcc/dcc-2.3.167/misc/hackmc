# This kludge of a shell script warps a sendmail.cf produced from a .mc file
#   to report some spam to the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (DCC)
#   in addition to rejecting it.
#
# Mail that is rejected by a sendmail access_db is reported via dccm to
#   a DCC server as extremely bulky or spam.  Error messages in the access_db
#    file must start with "DCC:" or they will be ignored by this mechanism.

# This script should be run in the sendmail cf/cf directory, and given a list
#   of .mc files, as in
#	cd cf/cf
#	.../misc/hackmc -AROT ../m4/cf.m4 local.mc > local.cf

# It seems to work on sendmail.cf generated for sendmail versions 8.11
#   through 8.14.3.  There is no guarantee that it will work with other
#   versions.  You must compare the result of this script with the unmodified
#   sendmail.cf.


# This script "denatures" RCS keywords in its output so that revisions of
#   the resulting sendmail.cf can be archived with RCS without losing
#   the original RCS lines from the Sendmail organization.

# In addition to sending mail blacklisted by the sendmail access_db to DCC,
# the following can also be turned on:

#   -x	turn on debugging

#   -A	send mail with bogus Mail_From domain names to DCC with a count of
#	"many" instead of only rejecting it.   See -M.

#   -R	silently discard unauthorized relay attempts after reporting them
#	to the DCC.  This mechanism also implies -f to ensure that relay
#	attempts do not leak if dccm is not running.

#   -r	reject unauthorized relay attempts after reporting them
#	to the DCC.  This mechanism also implies -f to ensure that relayed
#	attempts do not leak if dccm is not running.

#   -D	add a local rule that rejects mail from SMTP clients without reverse
#	DNS and reports the mail as spam to the DCC.
#	This has a fairly high false positive rate.

#   -O	modify the sendmail rules to treat access_db "OK" and "RELAY"
#	or "Spam:...FRIEND" entries as whitelisting the message.

#   -M	modify the sendmail rules generated by FEATURE(badmx), FEATURE(dnsbl),
#	FEATURE(enhdnsbl), FEATURE(block_bad_helo) so that mail rejected by
#	sendmail is reported via dccm to DCC with a count of "many".
#	See -A.

#   -T	modify the sendmail rules to trust (whitelist) mail from users
#	authenticated with an SMTP AUTH TRUST_AUTH_MECH() mechanism or from
#	SMTP clients with certificates verified with START TLS.  See -U
#	If STMP-AUTH used, TRUST_AUTH_MECH must be set in the .mc file and
#	sendmail must be built with SASL or otherwise have working SMTP auth.

#   -U	modify the sendmail rules to trust (whitelist) mail from users
#	authenticated with an SMTP AUTH TRUST_AUTH_MECH() mechanism.
#	SMTP clients with certificates verified with START TLS are not trusted
#	See -T.  TRUST_AUTH_MECH must be set in the .mc file and
#	sendmail must be built with SASL or otherwise have working SMTP auth.

#   -f	if dccm fails, reject mail with a temporary failure status code
#	instead of passing it.  This changes the default FEATURE(dcc)
#	parameters.  See dcc.m4.

#   -m m4
#	specifies the path to the m4 program as well as any m4 args
#	such as `hackmc -m "/usr/bin/m4 -D_CF_DIR_=/usr/share/sendmail/cf/"`
