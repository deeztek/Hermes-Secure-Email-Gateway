# create a per-user whitelist target directory, password, and so forth.

# This script creates the directories needed for per-addressee white
#   lists and log directories.  It also runs htpasswd to create an entry
#   in the Apache password file for the userdirs directory.

# The files and directories must be writable by both the httpd and dccm
#   processes.  That is assumed to be arranged by having the processes share
#   a group such as "www" and using a umask of 007.
#   The dccm log directories and files should not be globally readable
#   to protect the privacy of mail.
#   If dccm is run by a "user" such as "dcc", you might be able to
#   use suEXEC.  You might need to make a symbolic link of ~dcc/public_html"
#   to ~dcc/userdirs.

# The web "usernames" are related the per-user whitelist directory names
#   seen in env_To lines in DCC log files.  The whitelist and log directory in
#   "userdirs/local/xxx" is accessed with the user name "xxx".
#   "userdirs/esmtp/xxx@example.com" uses the user name "esmtp/xxx@example.com

# An additional directory named @prefix@/userdirs/tmp is created for the
#   CGI scripts that manage the per-user whitelists and logs.
