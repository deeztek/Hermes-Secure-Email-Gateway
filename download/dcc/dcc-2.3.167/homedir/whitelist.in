# whitelist file required by DCC server
#   Unless you are running a DCC server, this file will not be used.  Even
#   if you are running a DCC server, it is almost always better to put entries
#   in the client whiteclnt files.

#   See the dcc man page for the format of DCC white and blacklists.
#   Each line must be in one of the forms
#count [hex] type value
#      [hex] type value
#include pathname

# Whitelists for DCC servers are usually not a good idea except for local
#   IP addresses that are trusted to never send spam.  It is usually
#   better to use whitelists only with DCC clients such as dccproc, dccifd,
#   and dccm.

# Changes to this file or the files it includes have no effect until dbclean
#   is run, perhaps by the required daily cron job, @libexecdir@/cron-dccd
