# whitelist values common to the server and client
include whitecommon

# The following IP address entries usually should also be in @prefix@whitelist,
#   probably by putting them in @prefix@whitecommon and including that file
#   here and in @prefix@whitelist.
#
#   Do not tell the DCC servers about purely local mail.
#   Add lines listing all of the host names of this system.
#   These lines are best in the whitecommon file included in this file
#ok	ip	127.0.0.1
#ok	ip	::1
#
# List statically allocated IP addresses that you trust to never send
#   or forward unsolicited bulk email
#ok	ip	10.1.2.0/24
#
# List secondary MX relays or any MX relays that might forward spam to this
#	system.
#mx	ip	10.3.4.5
#mx	ip	10.6.7.0/28
#   Use mxdcc instead of mx if the relay does DCC checks
#mxdcc	ip	10.8.9.10
#
# List SMTP submission clients such as web browsers that cannot tolerate
#   4yz temporary rejections but that cannot be trusted to never send spam
#submit	ip	10.4.5.0/24



# Do not filter postmaster to avoid rejecting reports of spam.
#   As with all header checksums, all valid forms of the address must
#   be listed.
#ok	env_to	postmaster
#ok	env_to	postmaster@example.com
#ok	env_to	postmaster@host.example.com

# See http://www.iecc.com/dcc-testmsg-whitelist.txt for list of checksums
#   of practically blank messages.  Such checksums can be usefully whitelisted.
#   See @libexecdir@/fetch-testmsg-whitelist for a cron script to
#   fetch them.
#include testmsg-whitelist

# If dccm or dccifd is run with "-S mail_host" by adding that to DCCM_ARGS
#   or DCCIFD_ARGS in @prefix@/dcc_conf, then uncommenting the following
#   line would white-list all mail from the SMTP client at example.com.
#ok	substitute mail_host example.com

# If dccm, dccifd, or dccproc is run with "-S Mailing-list", then this line
#   would white-list all mail with either of two Mailing-List header
#   values:
#ok	hex substitute Mailing-List e78e0f7f b0d5212c 8a1a433a 769ad0fd
#ok	substitute Mailing-List host.example.com

# A lot of bulk mail lacks message-ID header lines.
#   If you receive much mail from lame mailing lists (often involving
#	qmail) or solicited bulk mail you probably do not want to use
#	this blacklist entry.
# many	message-id <>

# Mail with SMTP HELO values commonly used seen in spam can be rejected
#   and reported to the DCC server as spam by running dccproc, dccifd, or dccm
#   with "-S HELO" and uncommenting the following lines:
