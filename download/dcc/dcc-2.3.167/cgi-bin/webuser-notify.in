# send mail messages about new per-user DCC log files

# This script can be run by the daily DCC cron job after it has been
#	1. changed to contain the URL of the local DCC CGI scripts,
#	2. changed to use a locally suitable command to send mail
#	3. copied to the DCC libexec directory,
#	4. and made executable.
#   It is remotely possible that the default values in this script are
#	suitable and that you could use this script directly by putting
#	the following in the libexec directory:
#	    #! /bin/sh
#	    sh @prefix@/cgi-bin/webuser-notify -d $*
#
# This script expects to be called by the standard DCC cron job to read a
#   series of user names on stdin, each of which has a new log file.
#   Each user name must be prefixed with the appropriate subdirectory such
#   as "local/".  The single argument to this script must be the
#   DCCM_USERDIRS or DCCIFD_USERDIRS_directory made into an absolute path.
