<H1>Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (DCC) Installation</H1>

<P>
<OL>
<LI><H3>Fetch the Source and Read the License</H3>
The DCC source is available at
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/">dcc-servers.net</A>
and
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/">Rhyolite Software</A>.
<P>
Please <EM>do not</EM> try to use the ancient, modified
versions of DCC software distributed by some Linux packagers.
Those versions do not detect bulk mail as well as more recent versions.
Installations using those old versions also have problems using the
public DCC servers that often make it necessary to add their IP addresses
to the blacklist that protects the public DCC servers.
Even worse, all known Linux redistributions of DCC software have been
changed in ways that break things, including the
<A HREF="misc/updatedcc">@libexecdir@/updatedcc</A> shell script that could
otherwise be used to fetch, configure, compile, install, and restart
a current version.
<P>
The license on the free source is in the source as well as
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/LICENSE">dcc-servers.net</A>.
The free license is intended to cover individuals and organizations
including Internet service providers using DCC to filter their own mail.
Organizations selling anti-spam appliances or managed mail services are
not eligible for the free license.


<P><LI><H3>Read the Documentation</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="dcc.html#Installation-Considerations">DCC</A>
and other man pages describe the features, operating modes,
required data files, and other characteristics of the DCC.
Also see the DCC <A HREF=FAQ.html>FAQ</A>
or list of frequently answered questions.


<P><LI><H3><A NAME="step-sendmail">Build Sendmail</A></H3>
If the DCC-sendmail interface, <A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A>, is not used,
then <B>skip</B> to the <A HREF="#step-compile">next step</A>.
<P>
Sendmail must have the
Mail Filter API or Milter enabled.
Some systems such a FreeBSD 4.6 and newer are shipped with
Milter enabled and the library installed by default.
If your system comes with the Milter interface turn on,
then <B>skip</B> to the <A HREF="#step-compile">next step</A>.
Otherwise, the Milter interface must be explicitly enabled
by adding lines like those in
<A HREF="misc/site.config.m4">misc/site.config.m4</A>
to your sendmail/devtools/Site/site.config.m4 file or equivalent.
Then build sendmail as described in the INSTALL file distributed with sendmail.
You must build <CODE>libmilter</CODE> separately by something like
<PRE>
	    cd libmilter
	    sh ./Build
</PRE>
<P>
After sendmail has been rebuilt if necessary it will need to be restarted.
That should be done after <A HREF="#step-compile">the next step</A>
after <A HREF="misc/dcc.m4">misc/dcc.m4</A> has been created by the
<EM>./configure</EM> script.


<P><LI><H3><A NAME="step-compile">Configure, Build, and
Install the DCC Programs</A></H3>
<P>
See the installation considerations in the
<A HREF="dcc.html#Installation-Considerations">DCC man page</A>.
<P>
Most DCC files are in a "home directory" such as @prefix@.
DCC programs such as cdcc and dccproc are run by end
users and should be installed in a directory such as /usr/local/bin.
They must also be set-UID to the UID that can change the DCC
data files.
DCC programs that do not need to be run by end users
are installed by default in the libexec subdirectory of the DCC home directory.
See the <A HREF="#envtbl">table</A> of
<EM>./configure</EM> script and makefile parameters.
If necessary, set CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LIBS or other environment variables
listed in the <A HREF="#envtbl">table</A>.
Omit any parameters you don't really need to change.
<P>
End users installing only <A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A>
can install it in their private
<Q>~/bin</Q> directories and use private directories for their DCC
home directories.
In this case, the DCC programs that would otherwise need to be set-UID
need not be.
<P>
To build <A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A>
<A NAME="individual-user">for an individual user</A>,
use something like
<PRE>
	./configure <A HREF="#envtbl--disable-sys-inst">--disable-sys-inst</A> <A HREF="#envtbl--disable-dccm">--disable-dccm</A> <A HREF="#envtbl--homedir">--homedir=$HOME/dccdir</A>  <A HREF="#envtbl--bindir">--bindir=$HOME/bin</A>
	make install
</PRE>
<P>
If you do not intend to use the sendmail interface,
<A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A>, use something like
<PRE>
	./configure <A HREF="#envtbl--disable-dccm">--disable-dccm</A>
	make install
</PRE>
If you will use dccm,
it must be built with the sendmail source and object tree.
By default, the makefiles look for
native sendmail libraries (e.g. on FreeBSD), an installed "package"
(e.g. on FreeBSD), or a directory named sendmail parallel to the DCC
source and object tree.
Those who regularly build new versions of sendmail may find it convenient
to make a symbolic link there to their current sendmail.
Otherwise configure the dccm makefile with
<PRE>
	./configure <A HREF="#envtbl--with-sendmail">--with-sendmail</A>=/some/where/sendmail
	make install
</PRE>
If dccm does not build because it cannot find libmilter,
check that libmilter was compiled with sendmail
in the <A HREF="#step-sendmail">previous step</A>.
<P>
To connect the sendmail Milter interface to <A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A>,
copy or symbolically link <A HREF="misc/dcc.m4">misc/dcc.m4</A> to
your sendmail/cf/feature directory and
add <CODE>FEATURE(dcc)</CODE> lines to your sendmail.mc configuration file.
It can be useful to modify sendmail.cf by using
<A HREF="misc/hackmc">misc/hackmc</A>.
Then rebuild and reinstall your sendmail.cf file, and restart sendmail.


<P><LI><H3>Create Client Configuration Files</H3>
All DCC configuration files are in the DCC  home directory, usually @prefix@.
See the
<A HREF="dcc.html#Client-Installation">dcc</A>,
<A HREF="dccm.html#FILES">dccm</A>,
<A HREF="dccifd.html#FILES">dccifd</A>,
and <A HREF="dccproc.html#FILES">dccproc</A>
man pages
for the files each needs.
Example files are in the <A HREF="homedir/">homedir</A> directory in the source.

<UL>
<LI>Unless run anonymously, DCC clients need client-ID numbers and passwords
assigned by the operators of the chosen DCC servers in the @prefix@/map file.
<LI><P>Even if run anonymously, the @prefix@/map file must contain the IP addresses
of DCC servers.
If your mail system handles fewer than 100,000 mail messages per day,
the installation process generates a serviceable @prefix@/map file
from the included <A HREF="homedir/map.txt">homedir/map.txt</A> file.
That file points to the public DCC servers.

<LI><P>If using remote DCC servers such as the public DCC servers,
ensure that your firewalls allow outgoing packets to UDP port 6277
on distant systems and incoming responses from UDP port 6277.
There is a
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/firewall.html">description</A>
one firewall's configuration.

<LI><P>Your MX servers and mail submission clients should be listed in the main
<A NAME=whitelist HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">whiteclnt</A> file with lines like:
<PRE>
    mx		ip  10.2.3.4
    mx		ip  10.5.6.0/28
    mxdcc       ip  10.5.6.0/28
    ok		ip  10.7.8.9
    submit      ip  192.168.1.0/24
</PRE>
If those other systems also run DCC clients, use <EM>MXDCC</EM> instead
of <EM>MX</EM> so that messages will not be reported twice to the DCC network
and so have higher target counts,
and appear to be unsolicited bulk mail.
<P>
Use <EM>OK</EM> for mail systems that you trust to never send or
forward unsolicited bulk mail.
<P>
Untrusted SMTP clients such as end users with browsers used as
MUAs (mail user agents) should be listed in the
<A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">whiteclnt</A> file with <EM>submit</EM>.

<LI><P>Sources of legitimate bulk mail must be recorded in whitelists.
Example <A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">whiteclnt</A>,
<A HREF="homedir/whitelist">whitelist</A>, and
<A HREF="homedir/whitecommon">common</A> whitelists are among
the <A HREF="homedir/">sample configuration files</A> in the homedir directory.
The format of DCC whitelists is described in the
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">DCC</A> man page.

<LI><P>Put suitable values in the DCC configuration file,
<A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A> for dccm or dccifd.
The default client values are usually good for a start and often only
DCCM_REJECT_AT needs to be changed when it is time to reject spam.

<LI><P>Optionally configure DNS blacklist (DNSBL) checks in
<A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-B">dccm</A>
or
<A HREF="dccifd.html#OPTION-B">dccifd</A>
by setting DNSBL_ARGS in in the configuration file,
<A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A>, in the home directory.


<LI><P>Optionally create per-user directories for logs and whitelists.
See also the
<A HREF="cgi-bin/README">CGI scripts</A> in @cgibin@
that allow users to maintain their private whitelists
and monitor their individual logs of rejected mail.

<LI><P>Install a daily or more frequent cron job like
<A HREF="misc/crontab">misc/crontab</A>
and
<A HREF="misc/cron-dccd">@libexecdir@/cron-dccd</A>
to prune <A HREF="dccm.html#FILE-logdir">dccm</A> or
<A HREF="dccifd.html#FILE-logdir">dccifd</A>
log files and the prune dccd database with
<A HREF="dbclean.html">dbclean</A>.
</UL>

<LI><H3>Create Server Files and Start the Server</H3>
<B><A HREF="#step-greylist">Skip</A></B> this and the next step
if only remote DCC servers will be used.
You should use your own, local DCC servers only if your mail system handles
more than 100,000 mail messages per day.
If your mail system handles fewer than 100,000 mail messages per day,
you should use the public DCC servers.
The DCC client programs are configuerd to use the public DCC servers
by default.
<P>
It is best to use remote servers until the DCC client,
dccm, dccifd, or dccproc, is stable.
Then
<UL>
<LI>Put suitable values for dccd
 in the configuration file,
<A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A>.
Every DCC server requires a unique
<A HREF="dcc.html#Client-and-Server-IDs">server-ID</A>.
Obtain a server-ID by contacting Vernon Schryver at
<A HREF="mailto:vjs@rhyolite.com">vjs@rhyolite.com</A> by email
or via a
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/cgi-bin/ct.cgi?sb=DCC+server-ID">web form</A>.
<P>
On Linux or Solaris, consider adding -H to DBCLEAN_ARGS in @prefix@/conf.
See the <A HREF="dbclean.html#OPTION-H">dbclean man page</A>.

<LI><P>Choose a secret password for your server-ID in your
<A HREF="homedir/ids">@prefix@/ids</A> file.
This password is used to control your server with the
<A HREF="cdcc.html">cdcc</A> program.
Your server-ID must be unique
and can be obtained by contacting Vernon Schryver at
<A HREF="mailto:vjs@rhyolite.com">vjs@rhyolite.com</A> by email
or via a
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/cgi-bin/ct.cgi?sb=DCC+server-ID">web
form</A>.

<LI><P>If you have more than one DCC server,
ensure that there are common client-IDs with the same passwords in
the <A HREF="homedir/ids">@prefix@/ids</A> files on all of your servers
You should define a DNS name like dcc.example.com with A and AAAA records
for all of your DCC servers.
Then configure your DCC clients to spread their load among your DCC servers
with a command like
<PRE>
	cdcc "dcc.example.com  RTT-1000 ms  32768 secret"
</PRE>
where 32768 and secret are the common client-ID and password
found in @prefix@/ids on all of your DCC servers.

<LI><P>Start the server with the system by installing
<A HREF="misc/rcDCC">@libexecdir@/rcDCC</A> or an equivalent.
If it is used unchanged, rcDCC is best installed with a symbolic link
to automate installing updates.
The server can be started manually with
<PRE>
	rcDCC start
</PRE>

<LI><P>The script
<A NAME=cleaning HREF="misc/cron-dccd">@libexecdir@/cron-dccd</A>
<EM>must</EM> be used to run
<A HREF="dbclean.html">dbclean</A> about once a day.
An entry like <A HREF="misc/crontab">misc/crontab</A> can be put into
the crontab file for the user that runs dccd.
If you have more than one DCC server,
stagger the times at which the cron job is run so
that not all of your servers are simultaneously busy cleaning databases.

<LI><P>Install the shutdown script
<A HREF="misc/rcDCC">@libexecdir@/rcDCC</A>
to shut down the DCC server as the operating system stops.
If the DCC server fails to close the database cleanly,
the database must be cleaned by the server with it starts.
That takes time.

</UL>



<P><LI><H3><A NAME="step-flooding">Configure Flooding</A></H3>
<A HREF="#step-greylist">Skip to the next step</A>
if only remote DCC servers will be used.
<P>
Flooding requires that every server participating in a network of DCC
servers have a unique server-ID.
Server-IDs can be obtained by contacting Vernon Schryver at
<A HREF="mailto:vjs@rhyolite.com">vjs@rhyolite.com</A> by email
or via a
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/cgi-bin/ct.cgi?sb=DCC+server-ID">web
form</A>.
<P>
After you have an official server-ID,
<UL>
<LI>Obtain the <A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-flod">passwd-ID</A> and its password
and add them to your <A HREF="homedir/ids">@prefix@/ids file</A>.
<LI>If necessary adjust your firewalls to allow both incoming TCP connections
to port 6277 on your DCC server and outgoing TCP connections to port 6277
on your flooding peer.
<LI>Add a line for each flooding peer to
the <A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-flod">@prefix@/flod</A> file.
<LI>Wait a few minutes for dccd to notice the change to the file
and start flooding.
The <A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-stats">cdcc&nbsp;stats</A>,
<A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-flood-list">cdcc&nbsp;"id&nbsp;X;&nbsp;flood list"</A>
and
<A HREF="dblist.html#OPTION-H">@libexecdir@/dblist&nbsp;-Hv</A>
commands can be used to monitor the floods of reports of checksums
of bulk mail.
</UL>
<P>
Flooded reports of bulk email contain timestamps that are used for several
things including expiring old reports.
To accurately detect stale incoming reports,
a DCC server needs a clock that is not too inaccurate.
For that reason it is good to run an NTP daemon on systems running DCC servers.

<P><LI><H3><A NAME="step-greylist">Configure Greylisting</A></H3>
<B>Skip</B> to the <A HREF="#step-start-dccm">next step</A>
if greylisting will not be used.
Greylist is very effective.
See this
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/greylist.html">description</A>.
<P>
Larger sites can use more than one greylist server,
with the greylist servers flooding data just like DCC servers.
<P>
To configure greylisting:
<OL>
<LI><H4>Assign greylist client-IDs and server-IDs</H4>
<P>Client-IDs and matching passwords must be used by clients of
greylist servers such as dccm and dccifd.
The client-IDs must be in the @prefix@/map file on the client system.
Greylist client-IDs and server-IDs must be in the
<A HREF="homedir/ids">@prefix@/ids</A> file on the
greylist server.
When a system hosts both DCC and greylist servers, it is convenient
for clients to use the same client-ID and password for both.
It is also convenient for a greylist server and a DCC server on a system
to share a common server-ID and password.
<P>
The vast majority of installations do not have local DCC servers and
can use the greylist server-ID generated automatically in the
<A HREF="homedir/ids">@prefix@/ids</A> file.

<P><LI><H4>Add the greylist server to @prefix@/map</H4>
<P>If the
cdcc&nbsp;"<A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-info">info</A>"
command does not show the correct greylist server,
add it with something like
<PRE>
	cdcc "<A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-add">add localhost greylist 32768 secret"</A>
</PRE>
The DCC makefile files add a greylist server at localhost or 127.0.0.1
to <A HREF="cdcc.html#FILES">@prefix@/map</A> file created for a new
DCC installation.

<P><LI><H4>Set @prefix@/dcc_conf</H4>
In most installations, enable a local greylist server by
installing the script <A HREF="misc/rcDCC">@libexecdir@/rcDCC</A>
with a symbolic link,
setting  <EM>GREY_ENABLE=on</EM> in @prefix@/dcc_conf
and then running
<PRE>
	<A HREF="misc/rcDCC">@libexecdir@/rcDCC</A> start
</PRE>

<P>If absolutely necessary, override the greylist
<A HREF="dccd.html#OPTION-G">embargo, wait, and white</A> values
in GREY_DCCD_ARGS in @prefix@/dcc_conf.
Usually simply set GREY_CLIENT_ARGS=on

<P><LI><H4>Set @prefix@/grey_flod</H4>
<P>
Sites with more than one greylist server should arrange to flood
data among them by adding lines to
<A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-grey_flod">@prefix@/grey_flod</A> files
in the same format as
<A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-flod">@prefix@/flod</A> files.
Flooding among greylist servers uses port 6276 by default, and so that
port may need to be opened in firewalls.

<P><LI><H4>Set cron job</H4>
<P>
Install a daily cron job like
<A HREF="misc/crontab">misc/crontab</A>
and
<A HREF="misc/cron-dccd">@libexecdir@/cron-dccd</A>
to clean the database.
<P>

<P><LI><H4>Whitelist Mail Submission Clients</H4>
<P>
Greylisting of local mail systems must be turned off because common
mail user agents (MUAs) cannot handle temporary rejections.
One way to turn off greylisting of local client is with <EM>submit</EM> lines
in the main <A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">whiteclnt</A> file
as described <A HREF="#whitelist">above</A>.
<P>
An alternative to whitelisting mail submission clients is available with
<A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A> and sendmail by using the
<A HREF="misc/hackmc">misc/hackmc&nbsp;-T</A>
script to modify sendmail.cf to trust SMTP clients authenticated with
SMTP-TLS or SMTP-AUTH.

</OL>



<P><LI><H3><A NAME="step-start-dccm">Start dccm</A></H3>
If the DCC-sendmail interface, dccm, is not used,
<B>skip</B> to the <A HREF="#step-start-dccifd">next step</A>.
<P>
The DCC sendmail milter interface <A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A>
should be started before sendmail.
That often requires changing an /etc/rc script or configuration file.
The script <A HREF="misc/rcDCC">@libexecdir@/rcDCC</A>
should be installed, best with a symbolic link.
The milter daemon can be started manually with
<PRE>
	rcDCC start
</PRE>



<P><LI><H3><A NAME="step-start-dccifd">Start dccifd</A></H3>
If the general MTA interface, dccifd, is not used,
<B>skip</B> to the <A HREF="#configure-dccproc">next step</A>.
If you are using SpamAssassin, then you almost certainly
should be using dccifd.
<P>
The general MTA interface <A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd</A>
should usually be started before the mail transfer agent or MTA.
It should be enabled by setting <EM>DCCIFD_ENABLE=on</EM>
in <A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A>.
It is also usually necessary to change an /etc/rc script or configuration file
to start and stop the daemon with the system.
The script <A HREF="misc/rcDCC">@libexecdir@/rcDCC</A>
should be installed, best with a symbolic link.
The daemon can be started manually with
<PRE>
	rcDCC start
</PRE>
<P>
Dccifd can be used as a
<A HREF="http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_PROXY_README.html">Postfix Before-Queue
Content filter</A>
as described the
<A HREF="dccifd.html#EXAMPLES">dccifd man page</A>.


<P><LI><H3><A NAME="configure-dccproc">Configure Uses of dccproc</A></H3>
If dccproc is used with procmail,
add rules to procmailrc files as described in the
<A HREF="dccproc.html#EXAMPLES">dccproc man page</A>.

<P><LI><H3>Adjust Rejection Thresholds</H3>
<P>It is best to only mark mail with X-DCC SMTP headers
before changing procmail or dccm to reject mail.
Configure dccm with DCCM_LOG_AT in
<A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A>
to log bulk mail with somewhat lower counts.


<P><LI><H3>Additional Considerations</H3>
<P>Some additional mechanisms are available in the DCC client programs.
They are often unnecessary when
<A HREF="#step-greylist">greylisting</A> is used.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-B">DNS blacklists (DNSBL)</A>
can reject messages containing "spamvertised" URLs.
<LI><A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-t">DCC reputations</A>
are available in the commercial version of the DCC source.
</UL>

<P>
When possible, it is almost always better to use dccifd than dccproc.
This is certainly true with SpamAssassin.

When using SpamAssassin, ensure that the SpamAssassin plugin
DCC.pm is up to date.
The DCC source includes a
<A HREF="misc/DCC.pm">copy</A> in the misc directory.
Please consider setting dcc_learn_score to report spam to other
SpamAssassin with DCC users.



<P><LI><H3>Update As Needed</H3>
<P>New versions released at the
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/">usual place</A>
can be installed by running the
<A HREF="misc/updatedcc">@libexecdir@/updatedcc</A> script.
That script is (re)built by the
<EM>./configure</EM> script
and runs <EM>./configure</EM> with parameters and
environment variables from the previous installation.



<P><LI><H3>Remove or Uninstall</H3>
<P>Most of the DCC can be removed by running
<A HREF="misc/uninstalldcc">@libexecdir@/uninstalldcc</A> script.
Some logs and configuration files with locally chosen parameters in the home
directory are not deleted.
Manual changes such as links to
<A HREF="misc/rcDCC">@libexecdir@/rcDCC</A>
or the installation of the cron job,
<A HREF="misc/cron-dccd">@libexecdir@/cron-dccd</A>,
are not reversed.

<H2><A NAME="Compatibility">Compatibility</A></H2>
<P>DCC is thought to work on several systems including:
<DL class=compat>
<DT>BSDI BSD/OS
<DD>DCC works starting with version 3.0 of BSD/OS.

<DT>FreeBSD
<DD>The works starting with at least version 4.0 of FreeBSD.

<DT>NetBSD
<DD>DCC works without change starting with at least NetBSD 4.0.

<DT>OpenBSD
<DD>DCC works starting with at least 2.9 despite
the lame mmap() implementation.

<DT>Linux
<DD>Avoid the several years old, modified versions shipped by some
Linux packagers.
<P>
On 64-bit PowerPC systems with more than 4 GBytes,
use <EM>./configure --with-64-bits</EM> to build a DCC server that can
benefit from a full sized database.
A 64-bit sendmail milter library will be needed if
<A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A> is used

<DT>AIX
<DD>DCC on 4.1.PPC has been tried but not well tested.
Rumor has it that the 4.1.PPC pthreads code does not work
with the sendmail milter library and dccm, but the rest of
DCC does work.

<DT>Solaris
<DD>DCC compiles on several versions of Solaris with gcc or
native C compiler by setting the environment variable CC appropriately.
<EM>You must install gmake</EM>.
Do not use "CFLAGS=-fast" with the native compiler.
<P>
While building the sendmail milter library, consider using
<EM>_FFR_USE_POLL</EM> to avoid problems with large file descriptors
and select().
<P>
On 64-bit systems with more than 4 GBytes,
use <EM>./configure --with-64-bits</EM> to build a DCC server that can
benefit from a full sized database.
A 64-bit sendmail milter library will be needed if
<A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A> is used

<DT>HP-UX
<DD>DCC compiles on versions of HP-UX starting with 11.00.
It requires gmake.  Dccproc and dccm work.
Dccifd does not work with UNIX domain sockets because select() and
poll() do not notice the results of shutdown().
Dccifd does work with TCP/IP connections to MTAs or spam filters.
<BR>
Dccproc should work on version 10.20, since it does not use pthreads.

<DT>IRIX
<DD>DCC compiles on IRIX 6.5.
It requires gmake.

<DT>OSF1
<DD>DCC compiles on OSF1 V5.0 with gmake.

<DT>OpenUNIX
<DD>DCC compiles on OpenUNIX 8.0.1.

<DT>Mac OS/X
<DD>DCC compiles on at least some versions of Apple's OS/X.

<DT>Windows
<DD>The DCC client dccproc compiles and works on at least some versions of
Microsoft Windows 98, XP, and Vista with Borland's free SDK
and with Microsoft's SDK.
See the <A HREF="win32.mak">main Makefile</A> for Windows.


</DL>
<P>
<SMALL>Those system names include trademarks.  Please don't abuse them.</SMALL>

<H2><A NAME="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</A></H2>
<P>
Much of the DCC <A HREF=FAQ.html>list of frequently asked questions</A>
concerns troubleshooting DCC installations.
Many of the messages in the archive of the
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/pipermail/dcc/">DCC mailing list</A>
are also troubleshooting questions and answers.

<H2><A NAME="spam-traps"></A><A NAME="spamtraps">Spam Traps</A></H2>
<P><A HREF="dccm.html">Dccm</A> and sendmail can be configured to
report the checksums of unsolicited bulk mail so that other DCC clients
can reject later copies of the same unsolicited bulk mail
sent from other sources.
Such mechanisms are commonly called <EM>spam traps</EM>.

<P>Entries in a sendmail access_db can also be rejected or discarded
while they are reported to the DCC server by dccm.
The script
<A HREF="misc/hackmc">misc/hackmc</A> modifies the output of
sendmail .mc files to tell dccm about some undesirable mail.
The script accepts one or more .mc files and generates the corresponding
slightly modified .cf files.
If the access_db entry starts with the string "DCC:",
the message is reported by dccm to the DCC server as extremely bulky.
Otherwise the message is rejected as usual.
The remainder of the the access_db entry after "DCC:" consists of
the optional string "DISCARD" followed by an optional SMTP status message.
If the string "DISCARD" is present, the message is discarded instead of
rejected.  This is important to keep senders of unsolicited bulk mail from
discovering and removing "spam trap" addresses from their target lists.

<P>For example, a line like the following in an access_db can
discard all mail from example.com while reporting it to the DCC server
as extremely bulky.
 Note the quotes (").
<PRE>
    example.com     DCC: "DISCARD spam"
</PRE>

<P>Spam traps can be configured with
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">option&nbsp;spam-trap-discard</A>
and
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">option&nbsp;spam-trap-accept</A>
lines in
<A NAME=whitelist HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">whiteclnt</A> files.

<P>Mail from a spam trap address can be sent to
dccproc as described in the
<A HREF="dccproc.html#EXAMPLES">dccproc man page</A>


<H2><A NAME="SOCKS">SOCKS</A></H2>
<P>The DCC client and server programs can be built to use the SOCKS
protocol.
The
<A HREF="#envtbl--with-socks">--with-socks</A>
<EM>./configure</EM> parameter
configures the DCC client library and the DCC server
to use common SOCKS network library functions.
If the SOCKS library is in a standard place,
something like <A HREF="#envtbl--with-socks">--with-socks=socks</A>
should be sufficient.
Setting the environment variable
<A HREF="#envtbl-DCC_LDFLAGS">DCC_LDFLAGS</A> to something
like <Em>-L/usr/local/lib</Em> is sometimes helpful.
Otherwise, using <A HREF="#envtbl--with-socks">--with-socks</A>
without specifying the library name and setting <A HREF="#envtbl-LIBS">LIBS</A>
to the full pathname of the library
might work.
<P>
DCC client programs
including dccproc and dccm that use the DCC client library
must be told to use the SOCKS5 protocol with the
<A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-SOCKS">SOCKS&nbsp;on</A>
operation of
<A HREF="cdcc.html">cdcc</A>.
SOCKS5 is required instead of SOCKS4
because DCC clients communicate with DCC servers using UDP.

<P>
DCC servers can use SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 when exchanging
floods of reports of checksums.
Links between individual pairs of peers are configured with the
<Em>passive</Em> and <Em>SOCKS</Em> flags in the flod file described
in the <A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-flod">dccd</A> man page.
In both cases, the SOCKS library code must be configured, often
in the files /etc/socks.conf and /etc/socksd.conf.

<P>
When the DCC software is built with SOCKS,
IPv6 name resolution is turned off.

<P>
The DCC server and client programs have been tested with the
<A HREF="http://www.inet.no/dante/">DANTE</A> library and server.
The DANTE SOCKS implementation is also one of the FreeBSD "ports"
or packages.
<P>
Note that if a connection fails repeatedly, Dante will disable the rule
that failed and will eventually try the underlying connect()
call.
This fails in almost every SOCKS environment because there is
no available route for an ordinary connect().
Dante by default won't re-enable the failing rule.
To fix this, change BADROUTE_EXPIRE from the default of <EM>0*60</EM>
to <EM>5</EM> in include/config.h in the Dante source and recompile.
