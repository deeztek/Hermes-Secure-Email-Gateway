    2019/06/18 22:59:28 Rhyolite Software DCC 2.3.167-1.357 $Revision$

2.3.167
    Do not count a refusal to respond about reputations as no reputations.
    Fix `cdcc clients` display of counts larger than 4294967295.

2.3.166
    Add "no-reps" flag to lines in /var/dcc/ids to disable DCC Reputations
	for clients using that ID.  The format of lines in /var/dcc/ids
	is described in the dccd man page.

2.3.165
    Allow anonymous clients to ask about but not report DCC Reputations.

2.3.164
    With the expiration of U.S.Patent 6460050, replace the free version of the
	DCC software with former commercial version that includes
	DCC Reputations.

1.3.163
    Fix a recent bug on systems lacking both sysctl(boottime) and /proc/uptime.
	The symptom of the bug is that dccd complains that "dcc_db.hash was
	not synchronized" and refuses to start.

1.3.162
    Fix rare crash while adding a delayed record.

1.3.161
    Fix assertion botch introduced in 1.3.160 and reported by Stephan Schulz.
    Fix hash table corruption with dbclean -F or the new -u on Linux
	introduced in 1.3.160

1.3.160
    Add `dbclean -u` to cater to SSDs by delaying some file system writing
	until the system is shut down.  "-u" can be added to DBCLEAN_ARGS
	in /var/dcc/dcc_conf.
    Speed up processing of flooded reports.
    Fix dccifd crash reported by Grant Keller at Sonic.

1.3.159
    Stop using /usr/share/mk Makefiles on BSD systems in order to allow
	building on FreeBSD 11.
    Add ./configure --with-install-cmd=X --enable-pkg-make to facilitate
	as FreeBSD port without patches.
    Use /proc/uptime to compute boottime on Linux.
    Ignore host names defined as 0.0.0.0.
    Don't let the Received: header parsing for the sender IP address in
	dccifd and dccproc be fooled by HELO values like "[127.0.0.1]"
    Change URLs to use https

1.3.158
    Do not flood any reports to peers with "leaf=0"
    Fix crash in dccm, dccifd, and dccproc when time jumps backwards by
	more than than 1 millisecond.
    Adjust Makefiles for recent NetBSD.

1.3.155
    Fix `cdcc "help flood"`
    Try `cc -E -w` in ./configure to avoid fatal gcc warning about
	CPPFLAGS=-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 that currently breaks DCC packaging
	on archlinux and will affect other systems.

1.3.154
    Fix editline build problem in cdcc reported by Robert Pelletier.

1.3.153
    Resolve confusion between dccifd ASCII protocol options "no-grey"
	and "grey-off" pointed out by Mark Thomas.

1.3.152
    In `cdcc clients` output, suppress individual client addresses covered
	by an address block in the server /var/dcc/blacklist file except when
	explicitly requested as in `cdcc "clients 10.2.3.0/24"`.

1.3.151
    Compress bad client addresses for `cdcc clients`.

1.3.148
    Answer clients with bad client-IDs and passwords as if they were
	using the anonymous client-ID.
    Improve counting by dccd of clients in address blocks.

1.3.147
    Fix missing clients in `cdcc clients`.
    Fix NetBSD threads problem 1.3.146 reported by Petar Bogdanovic.

1.3.146
    Add -I to `cdcc clients`
    Reduce dccifd thread stack size to 512 KBytes for busy 32-bit systems
    Fix some problems in the Windows version of dccproc.

1.3.145
    Suppress some error messages about broken DCC clients from dccd.
    Fix default start and stop Linux run levels in rcDCC as suggested by
	Herve Eychenne.
    Change start-dccifd to use `kill` instead of `/bin/kill` to accommodate
	Linux systems where /bin/kill does not understand `/bin/kill -9 -$PID`
	as the way to kill a process group.
    `cdcc src` now accepts a pair of IPv4,IPv6 addresses.
    Requests from anonymous DCC clients to the public DCC servers are grouped
	by IPv4 /24 or IPv6 /56 address blocks for inflating the delay.

1.3.144
    Fix a rare crash of dccd, the server daemon.
    Allow "." in -B for dccifd, dccm, and dccproc as the base domain
	name of DNSBL to support detecting and rejecting mail containing
	URLs listed in a response policy zone (RPZ).

1.3.143
    Fix `dccifd -V` broken in 1.3.142 reported by Chris Burton.
    Fix "incompatible whitelist" SMTP bug in dccifd introduced in 1.3.139.
    Deal with default -mstructure-size-boundary=8 in FreeBSD on ARM as
	suggested by Ronald Klop.  However, intermittent failures of
	`cdcc "id 1; stats"` on FreeBSD 9.0-STABLE on a system with a
	"Feroceon 88FR131 rev 1 (Marvell core)" seem to be caused by broken
	consistency between write() and mmap().  That suggests that while
	the DCC client software should generally work, the DCC server will
	occassionally fail mysteriously.
    Fix dccm parsing of Received headers for MX and MXDCC whiteclnt lines
	that broke in verseion 1.3.139.

1.3.142
    Improve physical page locality of the DCC server's use of the database
	hash table and so improve server performance.
    The nagios script in var/dcc/libexec/dcc-nagios now compares the clock
	on the DCC server with the local clock.
    `cdcc -VV` and other commands produce the ./configure parameters used to
	build them.
    Build cdcc with editline.
    Add -P to dccproc, dccifd, dccm, and dccsight.

1.3.141
    Fix "MTA-last" in dcc man page as suggested by Bram Grietens.
    Fix no_forced-discard typo reported by Bram Grietens.
    Fix dccm to honor `hackmc -R` and discard relay attacks.
    misc/DCC.pm, which is generated from misc/DCC.pm.in, is now very
	similar to what will probably be in SpamAssassin 3.4.
    Fix problems finding native milter library for dccm pointed out by
	Kevin A. McGrail.
    Improve documentation or help output from the nagios plugin,
	/var/dcc/libexec/dcc-nagios
    Fix bug in misc/DCC.pm in dealing with mail that already has an
	X-DCC header found and diagnosed by Herbert J. Skuhra.

1.3.140
    tweak some HTML in the whiteclnt proof-of-concept pages
    Fix bug in `wlist` display of address blocks reported by Rob McMahon.
    Fix missing IP address in log files for mail from (as opposed to
	relayed by) MX relays.

1.3.139
    Give temporary rejections by dccm and dccifd for conflicting per-user
	thresholds a separate message.
    Add FreeBSD "faststart" to rcDCC.

1.3.138
    Fix bad URL decoding reported by Kostik.

1.3.137
    Fix some innocuous compilers warnings on Solaris and Ubuntu.

1.3.136
    Fix dccd and cdcc for `cdcc clients` for large operation counts.
    Deal with trailing '.' and other punctuation URLs in dccm, dccifd, and
	dccproc as pointed out by Kostik.  This changes the FUZ1 and FUZ2
	checksums in some cases.
    Fix a free(0).

1.3.135
    /var/dcc/map on 32 and 64 bit versions of a system are now the same.
    Dccproc, dccm, and dccifd decode HTML &#xxx character references in URLs.
    Dccproc, dccm, and dccifd convert UTF-8 domain names to Punycode
	before checking DNS blacklists.
    Deal with Linux `logger` bug that does the wrong thing with something like
	`logger message with -S dash S` as suggested by Leandro Santi.

1.3.134
    Fix compile bug reported by Rob.McMahon involving old compilers
	without "inline"

1.3.133
    Fix DNSBL bugs in parsing http://example.com?parameter and
	http://example.com:80 reported by Kostik
    Increase number of distinct kinds of local or "substitute" headers that
	can be locally white- or blacklisted to 8

1.3.132
    Fix fstatfs() wrapper on Ubuntu and speed up dccd and dbclean when
	a memory file system is used with -H.

1.3.131
    Fix minor bug in updatedcc and fetch-testmsg-whitelist as suggested by
	Taso N. Devetzis.
    Find in_port_t in sys/types.h as reported by Josh Allen.

1.3.130
    Fix serious bug reported by Bart Dumon in DNS whitelists on systems
	without strlcpy().

1.3.129
    Adjust dnswl.org in the sample dcc_conf file.

1.3.128
    Support DNS whitelists.  An example using dnswl.org is in the sample
	homedir/dcc_conf file.
    Fix dccproc, dccifd, and dccm crash in parsing Received: fields with
	IPv6 addresses.
    Parse IPv6 address literals lacking the "IPv6:" tag in Received: headers.

1.3.127
    Fix problem with `dbclean -H` after a system reboot reported by Gary Mills.
    Fix "duplicate symbol" problem on MacOS X or Darwin 10.3.0
	reported by Robert Pelletier by removing the use of `ranlib -c`.
	I hope this does not break things on older versions of MacOS X
	or future DCC releases.
    Fix printf compiler warnings on MacOS X.

1.3.126
    Fix another problem in flooding server-ID types past server-ID mappings.

1.3.125
    Fix stack corruption in version *.3.124.

1.3.124
    Fix reporting of rogue server-IDs.
    Remove vestiges of obsolete server-ID tracing.
    Flood server-ID types past flod file mappings.

1.3.123
    Another ./configure adjustment for NetBSD.
    Release /var/dcc/libexec/ck2ip
    Fix bug that broke DCC Reputation server count statistics.
    Put "reps=0%" into X-DCC header when that is the answer.
    Add "cksums" to the MTA-to-dccifd ASCII protocol for SpamAssassin
	auto-learn. See /var/dcc/build/dcc/misc/DCC.pm or
	http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/misc/DCC.pm
    Fix `dccm -aIGNORE` bug reported by Chris Aseltine.
    Add "option greylist-log-on" and "option greylist-log-off" for
	whiteclnt files.  greylist-log-on makes spam wait until after
	a greylist embargo before it is rejected and spam does not reset
	the embargo for a greylist triple.

1.3.122
    Adjust `./configure --with-make-cmd=path` for NetBSD as suggested by
	Petar Bogdanovic.

1.3.121
    Fix `hackmc -T` to work with sendmail.mc FEATURE(`delay_checks')
    Add `hackmc -U` to whitelist authenticated SMTP clients like -T but
	unlike -T not whitelist SMTP clients with verified STARTTLS
	certificates.  Too many sources of spam have good TLS certs.
    Fix `hackmc -M` to change sendmail.cf to terat Feature(badmx) and
	Feature(block_bad_helo) like Feature(dnsbl) and Feature(enhdnslb)
	and report bad mail to DCC before rejecting it.
    Dccm with `hackmc -R` should reject mail for unauthorized relaying despite
	whitelisting in whiteclnt files and "option MTA-first".
    Add <META HTTP-EQUIV="x-dns-prefetch-control" CONTENT="off"> to
	the proof-of-concept whitelist CGI scripts.
    Add ./configure --with-make-cmd=x to ease the use of bmake
    /var/dcc/libexec/dcc-nagios notices forced-passive and auto-NAT signs
	of DCC flooding problems.
    Turn off RES_DEFNAMES and RES_DNSRCH for name DNS blacklists to stop
	extra queries reported by Bart Dumon.
    Fix inversion of dccd -f/-F in 1.3.120 reported by Tomasz Potega.


1.3.120
    Add `dbclean -H` to optionally put the /var/dcc/dcc_db.hash file in
	a RAM file system such as /dev/shm or /tmp on Linux or Solaris
	systems that lack mmap(MAP_NOSYNC).  This significantly speeds up
	dccd.  Use (or stop using) it by adding (or removing) something like
	-H/dev/shm to DBCLEAN_ARGS in /var/dcc/dcc_conf and manually running
	or waiting for the nightly run of the /var/dcc/libexec/cron-dccd
	cron job.
	DO NOT put the dcc_db file in a transient or RAM file system.
	`dbclean -H` is bad for DCC servers on systems such as FreeBSD that
	have mmap(MAP_NOSYNC).
	The memory file system must have space for two copies of dcc_db.hash.
    Fix bug in updatedcc related to "-c --with-fetch_cmd=X" reported by
	Eddy Beliveau
    Make `dccd -T WLIST` the default.  WLIST tracing causes dccd to
	send messages like this to the system log:
	  REPORT whitelisted ... from ID 32768 at 10.2.3.4,61250
	when an authenticed DCC client reports a mail message that is
	whitelisted by /var/dcc/whitelist or the /var/dcc/whitecommon which
	is often included in /var/dcc/whitelist.  The system log messages
	help find DCC clients with missing or broken /var/dcc/whiteclnt files.
	DCC server operators should whitelist 127.0.0.1, ::1, and their
	local networks.  They can be turned off by adding -TNO-WLIST to
	/var/dcc/dcc_conf.  See the sample files at
	    http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/homedir/whitecommon
	    http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/homedir/whitelist
	    http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/homedir/whiteclnt
    Fix significant performance problems in dccd on systems with sufficient
	RAM.

1.3.117
    Fix URL encoding of + in proof-of-concept CGI scripts
    Repair replacement for getifaddrs() for systems that lack it including
	Solaris.  This is important for the DCC server's detection of 
	network interfaces that come and go.

1.3.116
    Fix broken `dccifd -Q` reported by Mark Thomas.
    Fix dccifd and dccproc parsing of Return-Path:<> reported
	by Wolfgang Breyha.
    Significantly improve compression on server-to-server flooding.

1.3.115
    Fix dccd crash in 1.3.114 reported by John Levine.

1.3.114
    Make `/var/dcc/libexec/dcc-nagios -s server` monitor the number of
	working floods.
    Fix the high RTT bug reported by Petar Bogdanovic and Mike Cappella.
    Speed up dbclean.

1.3.113
    Work around broken updatedcc in version 1.3.109

1.3.112
    Fix dccproc, dccm, and dccifd -B...,any, bug reported by Bart Dumon.
    Add dccproc, dccm, and dccifd -Bdomain,IPaddr,all-names as suggested by
	Bart Dumon.
    Delete ill conceived dccm, dccproc, dccifd -Bset:temp-fail
    Add /var/dcc/libexec/dcc-nagios

1.3.111
    fix "trap -" hiccup in updatedcc on Solaris

1.3.109
    Add Dutch to FUZ2 checksums with `./configure --enable-lang-Dutch`
    Change handling of send() and sendto() failures in the DCC client code
	to deal with strangeness in FreeBSD jails.
    Fix bug with IPv6 disabled on Linux.

1.3.108
    Change homedir/fix-map so that the FreeBSD package can use it to generate
	passwords.
    Tweak the response of the DCC client code to ostensibly impossible EINVAL
	from connect() in the hope of helping dccifd in FreeBSD jails.

1.3.107
    Fix problem with FreeBSD dcc-dccd package.

1.3.106
    Reduce the number of system calls used by dccproc to decide whether
	IPv6 is available.
    Fix bugs in ./configure --with-configsuffix=x and --with-installroot
	as proposed by Craig Green.  This will fix updatedcc in the
	FreeBSD port and package.
    Fix dccifd core dump on NetBSD reported by Petar Bogdanovic and
	Mike Cappella.

1.3.105
    Fix NetBSD client problem reported by Petar Bogdanovic by fixing
	select() usage and changing the ./configure script so that
	NetBSD uses poll() instead of select.

1.3.104
    Fix bogus 0 second retries for DNSBL lookups in dccm, dccifd, and dccproc.
    Accept blocks of addresses in whitelists and elsewhere as starting
	and ending pairs like 10.2.3.4-10.5.6.7 as well as CIDR blocks.
    Reduce name space pollution for sites using dccif() in dcclib.a.
    Fix IPv6 ifindex bug reported by Joe Breu.
    Change IPv6 support to use separate sockets instead of sharing IPv4
	sockets.  This is necessary on FreeBSD systems with IPv4 mapped
	addresses in IPv6 sockets turned off.
    Ignore and replace settings of "IPv6 on" and "IPv6 off" in existing
	/var/dcc/map files with new values name "IPv6 on", "IPv6 off", and
	"IPv6 only".  The new default of "IPv6 on" combined with distinct
	socket change described above should make DCC client programs including
	dccproc, dccifd, and dccm seamlessly use avaliable IPv6 and IPv4 DCC
	servers.  "IPv6 only" and "IPv6 off" should not be needed but are
	available just in case.
    Ignore `dccd -6` and `dccd -4` instead of enabling IPv6.  The server code
	now opens IPv6 and IPv4 sockets to receive requests from clients
	corresponding to IPv6 and IPv4 addresses on network interfaces.
	I think the right things happen if the DCC server has no IPv6 support
	and if the server has only link-local or site-local addresses.

1.3.103
    Quiet RedHat versus Debian error message from rcDCC reported by Ken Rea.
    Deal with corrupt /var/dcc/map reported by Steve Martin instead of
	calling abort().
    Fix error in libexec/fetch-testmsg-whitelist reported by Horst Scheuermann
	and William Taylor.
    Tweak ./configure and makefiles to try to avoid the mysterious,
	unreproducable linking problem reported by John Levine.
    Fix bug with `./configure --with-max-log-size=0` reported by
	Valentin Schmid.
    `./configure --with-max-log-size=KB` now also applies to dccproc log files.
    Generate man pages with /var/dcc and other directories replaced by
	local ./configure choices.  This is intended to help the FreeBSD
	package	and similar redistributions.

1.3.102
    Fix build error reported by Steve Martin in dnsbl.c on MacOS X and other
	systems without a resolver library found by ./configure.

1.3.101
    Fix inconsistent declaration of grey_on in dccd/dump-clients/dump-clients.c
	reported by Bobby Rose.

1.3.100
    Support groups of DNS blacklists that can be independently enabled
	in per-user whiteclnt files.
    Follow Petar Bogdanovic's suggestion to make ./configure assume that 
	`su -` and the default file ownership on NetBSD should be like FreeBSD
    Another tweak to reduce spurious DCC Reputations for 127.0.0.1.
    Dccifd in query mode assumes one recipient and so always generates an
	X-DCC header.
    Tweak proof of concept per-user whitelist cgi scripts in cgi-bin.
    Improve long term client request rate computation to improve how public
	DCC servers handle too active clients.
    Count anonymous clients ignored by `dccd -uFOREVER` among `cdcc stats`
	"bad IDs" to more easily detect local clients that lack client-IDs
	and passwords.
    `misc/hackmc -M` now reports mail rejected with the sendmail
	FEATURE(`badmx') to the DCC with counts of "MANY"

1.3.99
    Fix typo in Makefile.inc for NetBSD and OSF1 reported by Petar Bogdanovic.

1.3.98
    Change the DCC server to not sign responses to anonymous clients with
	the client's sequence numbers in protocol version 9.
    Add `dccd -T wlist` and `cdcc "trace wlist on"` to help find failures
	by clients to whitelist IP addresses and other checksums
	in /var/dcc/whitelist.
    Let whitelisting by the MTA, DCC server, or other whiteclnt lines override
	"option spam-trap-accept" and "option spam-trap-reject" whiteclnt
	lines as suggested by Horst Scheuermann.
    Finally document in the man pages parameters including %CIP that can be
	used in dccifd and dccm rejection messages.

1.3.97
     Fix "pthread_mutex_lock(cwf): Invalid argument; fatal error" reported
	by Steve Martin.

1.3.96
    Add `cdcc "clock check" to help detect broken clocks at DCC servers.
    Fix intermittent complaints about whiteclnt.dccw reported by Gary Mills.
    `cdcc clients` now indicates clients that have pegged a server's
	anti-DoS delays.

1.3.95
    Stop rare "fcntl(F_SETLKW F_WRLCK info  -1): Bad file descriptor" complaints
	when dccm and dccifd start.

1.3.94
    Fix core new dump in version 1.3.93 of dccm with aborted mail messages.

1.3.93
    Make the default value for the `dccm -j` and `dccifd -j` job limit
	as large as possible.  This makes -j settings unnecessary.
    Dccproc and cdcc time out after about 1 minute when the /var/dcc/map
	file is not unlocked.
    Add "option spam-trap-accept" and "option spam-trap-reject" to
	whiteclnt files.  I think these are the best way to build
	DCC spam traps.

1.3.92
    Improve the hash function used in the DCC server database.
    Replace -Bno-envelope for dccm, dccproc, and dccifd with
	-Bno-client and -Bno-mail_host for Tony Del Porto.  It seems that
	Spamhaus' PBL should generally not be applied to SMTP envelope
	Mail_From domain names to avoid rejecting mail received through an
	ISP smart-host but with sender domain name hosted on a dynamically
	assigned IP address.  The now undocumented -Bno-envelope implies
	-Bno-client and -Bno-mail_host.
    Fix the @configsuffix@ mechanism in homedir/Makefile.in as suggested
	by Craig Green.
    Switch to -lpthread threads on FreeBSD starting with 6.2 because of
	recent problems with libc_r threads.
    Dccproc should not require a "option DNSBL-on" line in /var/dcc/whiteclnt
	to pay attention to DNSBL hits.  The -B settings on the dccproc
	command line are sufficient to show that the user wants DNSBL checking.
    Fix bug in compression of DCC Reputation reports.

1.3.91
    Fix mechanism that should prevent dccd from starting dbclean for a quick
	cleaning about the time the cron job runs.
    Let DNSBL target addresses be CIDR blocks to improve the use of Spamhaus' 
	lists.
    Fix DNSBL bug that caused false positives reported by Ray Gardener.
    Tweak homedire/Makefile.in for the gento folks.
    Fix recent compiling bug with Borland on WIN32 reported by Tommy Barberis.

1.3.90
    Fix updatedcc problem reported by Chris Magnuson.
	Updatedcc failed after shutting down the localhost DCC server and
	finding no working server and when the environment variable
	DCC_UPDATEDCC_FAST is not set to "yes".  The easiest work-around
	is to add the public DCC servers to the local /var/dcc/map file
	with `cdcc "add dcc1.dcc-servers.net RTT+1000 ms"`  Besides working
	around the updatedcc problem, that uses the public DCC servers
	as backups for the local server.

1.3.89
    Repair compile problem on Solaris

1.3.88
    Repair rate limiting on dccd syslog complaints.
    Relax dccd load sharing enough to prevent spurious timeouts by
	keepalive timers and some troubles with flood connections.

1.3.87
    Add `./configure --enable-64-bits` to compile 64-bit DCC server code
	for Solaris or Linux PowerPC.  If you are using dccm, you will
	need to build a 64-bit sendmail milter library.
    Fix complaint from `cdcc "new map"` about the new file being empty.
    Fix bug in `./configure --with-installroot=DIR` and `make install`
	reported by Pavel Urban.
    Fix at least some causes of "continue not asking Greylist" complaints
	from dccm and dccifd.
    Make dbclean on Linux systems with lots of RAM even closer to -F.

1.3.86
    Disable automatic 64-bit compilation for Solaris again

1.3.85
    Fix Redhat Enterprise 5.1 build bugs in 1.3.84 reported by Mark Thomas.
    Fix old glitch in building for 64-bit Solaris systems.

1.3.84
    Allow very large DCC database hash tables, including that used
	for greylisting.
    Add `./configure --with-configsuffix=.str` to improve FreeBSD port.
    Add `rcDCC -m {dccd|dccm|...}` to improve FreeBSD port.
    Add magic comments to rcDCC to make it work with SUSE insserv.

1.3.83
    Deal with build problem on FreeBSD 7.0 reported by Craig Green.
    Keep client IP addresses as old as 7 days in /var/dcc/dccd_clients
	and /var/dcc/grey_clients

1.3.82
    Fix automagic upgrade of old /var/dcc/map files reported by James Carlson
	and Earl Killian.  The bug was new with 1.3.81.

1.3.81
    improve SMTP status messages from dccm and dccifd
    improve dbclean handling of less frequent spam
    do something like `dbclean -F` on systems that lack mmap(MAP_NOSYNC).
	This should help recent versions of Linux that thrash themselves
	much as Solaris always has.
    perhaps fix the "Deadlock situation detected/avoided" messages long
	but infrequently seen on Solaris.
    fix a bug reported by Edward Toton in the mechanism that works around a
	missing cron-dccd cron job.
    fix problem in cron-dccd reported by Dean Maluski when a greylist server
	is running but no DCC server.

1.3.80
    fix bug with `dccm -t` log thresholds reported by Bart Dumon

	flood error messages.

1.3.70
    /var/dcc/libexec/dcc-stats-graph no longer combines RRD files to

	warnings instead of fatal errors.

1.3.63
    Correct error in `cdcc "flood list"` announced negotiation of DCC
	Reputations.

1.3.62
    Let "option threshold type,val" lines in whiteclnt file accept "all"

1.3.57
    Fix bug in libexec/fetchblack adding a local blacklist file
	reported by Krzysztof Snopek.
    Make the system host name be the default value of `dccifd -D`
	so that local user name for per-user logs and whiteclnt files
	is "user" given SMTP recipient address "user@host.example.com"
	on the system named user.host.example.
    Support wildcards so that `dccifd '-D*example.com'` will take
	"user" as the local name for per-user logs and whiteclnt files
	vien SMTP recipient address user@host.exaple.com.
    Fix bug in version 1.3.56 of dbclean in computing the hash table size
	when upgrading from 1.3.42 reported by Domenico Diacono.

1,3,56
    Dccd continues parsing /var/dcc/blacklist after a bad line instead
	of stopping.
    Change dcc-stats-graph to not use --alt-y-mrtg with rrdtool version 1.2.
    Do not save dccd client list when running with -Gon.
    Dccd continues to inflate queue wait for 5 minutes after flooding

	or otherwise disturb things by installing the same version.
    Improve server queue delay measurement when the system is too slow
	to keep up with incoming floods.
    Do not use MAXHOSTNAMELEN for domain name lengths because on Linux
	it is only 64 bytes.  This implies a new version of the /var/dcc/map
	file.  Old versions of the file are automatically upgraded, but that
	implies problems if you install old versions of the DCC client
	programs.
    Dccm, dccifd, and dccproc delete all old X-DCC headers instead of only
	those with the same brand name as the current DCC server to fix
	problem reported by Frank Tegtmeyer.
    Fix unrecognized data /var/dcc/dccd_clients message.
    Improve DCC server hash table size estimation to help servers with

    Fix "flooding not stopped before ADMN DB UNLOCK" problem reported by
	Tomasz Potega.
    dcc-stats-graph no longer labels "Spam Ratio" graphs with '%' because

1.3.55
    Dccd falls back on foreground DNS resolution of flooding peer names
	when fork() fails, perhaps because of a lack of swap space.

	"Precedence: bulk" header so that the vacation program won't
	respond to the CGI cron script's mail messages.
    Change cgi-bin/webuser-notify to handle per-user log subdirectories
	generated by "option log-subdirectory-*" in whiteclnt files.

	systems that have less that 4 GByte of RAM.
    Set the GID of dccifd, dccm, and dccproc log files and subdirectory

    Fix a very rare infinite loop in the MIME decoding code in DCC clients.
    Add "option log-subdirectory-{day,hour,minute}" to whiteclnt files

	"improvements."

1.3.43
    Make "option forced-discard-nok" in /var/dcc/whiteclnt the default for
	dccm as well as dccifd in proxy mode.
    Add whiteclnt type of IP address entry "submit".
	It is intended to be applied to the IP addresses of SMTP submission
	clients such as web browsers that cannot tolerate 4yz temporary
	rejections of mail, but that cannot be trusted to not send spam.
    Let body and reputation checksum thresholds be set in the global and
	per-user whiteclnt files.  "Never" is a valid threshold and turns
	off rejections for a checksum.
    Overhaul proof of concept per-user whiteclnt CGI scripts to handle
	per-user checksum thresholds.
    Rationalize /var/dcc/libexec/dcc-stats-graph -tTITLE
    Fix bugs with -eNEVER and -Enever in dbclean.

	public DCC server blacklist are down for long periods.
    Limit the database window to less than 2 GBytes on all 32-bit systems

	do the right thing if it allowed large files.
    Fix bugs in the "skipping asking DCC server" mechanism that made it
	too forgiving.
    Remove the `dccd -t` thresholds in favor of simple constants.
    Dccm, dccifd, and dccproc now emit X-DCC headers for locally white-
	and blacklisted messages even when no DCC server responds.
    Automatically compensate for incompatibility in newer versions of
	rrdtool.
    Prefer poll() to select() on Linux.
    Increase the computed limit on `dccm -j` by not dedicating two FDs
	to each thread for per-user log files but instead doing some locking.

1.3.42
    Correct wrong count of `cdcc "clients -i 10.11.12.13"`
    Change rcDCC.in back to allow the use of /var/run for PID files.

	even when tracing is off.
    Fix missing ';;' in libexec/logger as suggested by James Carlson.
    Restore `start-dccm -c` that was removed from version 1.3.39 with the
	mistaken idea that -c was not in use.
    Fix bug counting clients of public DCC servers introduced in 1.3.39.
    Adding -d to DCCD_ARGS or GREY_DCCD_ARGS causes dccd to say how it
	determines the size of available memory.
    Deal with sysctl(HW_PHYSMEM) on amd64 FreeBSD 6.* need for an 8-byte value
	without breaking sysctl(HW_PHYSMEM) on FreeBSD 5.* that demands a
	4-byte value.
    Allow databases larger than 3 GBytes on 64-bit systems.

1.3.39
    Fix bug that caused `cdcc "clients -V"` to sometimes report version
	numbers of '?'.
    Change dccd to prefer recycling an old, almost idle client rate-limiting
	block instead of the oldest block.
    Modify /var/dcc/libexec/list-clients based on a suggestion from Chris Myers.

1.3.38
    Add `cdcc "clients x.y.z.w/p"`

1.3.37
    Fix problems in /var/dcc/libexec/list-clients and with `cdcc clients`
	with IPv6 addresses reported by Vincent Schonau.

    Fix dccm crash reported by John Doherty.

1.3.34
    Fix bug in `make install` on Solaris introduced in 1.3.33.

1.3.33

	by Jakob Hirsch.

1.3.32
    Fix dccd crash as suggested by Wolfgang Breyha.
    Do not try to stat() missing whiteclnt files more often than once every
	5 seconds.  This should significantly reduce the number of stat()
	system calls on busy systems using dccifd and SpamAssassin.
    Fix some problems with determining the mail sender through MX forwarders
	for second and subsequent mail messages in an SMTP session.
    Recognize some more qmail variations of Received headers for obtaining
	IP addresses.
    Add `cdcc "clients -V"`.
    Optionally in dccm and by default in dccifd in proxy mode temporarily
	reject SMTP recipients that might be forced to have spam discarded
	instead of rejected because it must be delivered to other
	recipients.

1.3.31
    Mention /var/dcc/libexec/uninstalldcc in the installation instructions.
    Change dccm and dccifd per-user log message for mail that is now being
	accepted after being temporarily rejected for some other recipient

	Spike Ilacqua.
    Fix failure to reset "continue not asking" counter problem reported
	by Breno Moiana.

    Fix bug that kept some DCC Reputations from being compressed in
	the database.
    Change the default DCC Reputation rejection message to the equivalent of
	-r '%s bad reputation; see http://commercial-dcc.rhyolite.com/cgi-bin/reps.cgi?tgt=%s'

1.3.27
    Fix an odd case where flooding connections between DCC servers were
	not being shut down.  I think it only happened when a firewall
	or something else systematically filtered TCP FINs.
    Use setresgid() for setegid() on HP-UX to fix problem reported by
	Giacomo Fazio.

1.3.26
    Compression reputation reports from the same week instead of from
	the same half day.  This significantly reduces the size of the
	database on systems using DCC Reputations.
    Restore the flood rate limiting based on TCP windows, but now just
	ignore the bogus EAGAIN complaints from some versions of Solaris.
    Fix server whitelists broken in 1.3.21.

1.3.25
    Fix dccproc crash when given a bogus env_From value diagnosed by
	Jeff Mincy.
    Fix greylist triple checksum in dccm and dccifd log files.
    Fix the default expiration of DCC Reputation checksums at 30 days and
	2 days unaffected by the system's amount of RAM.
    Expire FUZ1 checksums in reports that also have FUZ2 checksums.  This
	significantly reduces the size of the DCC server database.
    Remove new flood output rate limit using SO_SNDBUF because it causes some
	versions of Solaris to generate persistent EAGAIN errors for send().
    Fix at least some of the dccifd memory leak reported by Chris Mikkelson.
	It may be the same as the leak reported by Gunther Richter.
    Limit worst case DCC client delays exclusive of delays caused by waiting
	for DNS blacklists or external filters are limited to about 16 seconds.

1.3.24
    Dccproc starts dccifd after 500 uses at least as fast as 0.1/second.
	With luck SpamAssassin will notice and switch to dccifd.
    Look for libsmutil.a in /usr/lib on Linx for old RedHat
	as suggested by Jason Balicki.
    Fix X-DCC header misplaced by dccproc reported by James McNutt.

1.3.23
    Fix bug in dccm, dccproc, and dccifd that tripled effective DCC target
	counts on messages being retransmitted after greylisting.  I
	introduced this bug in version 1.3.21, which was released 3 days ago.

1.3.22
    Fix "POSSIBLE ATTACK" complaint from sendmail about trailing '\n'
	on headers added by dccm reported by Paul Ganci.

1.3.21
    Add a crude cache or database to the proof-of-concept scripts in
	cgi-bin/common to speed them up on large log directories.
	The goal is to handle log directories with 40,000 files within a
	second or two.  The caches files are built incrementally.
    Invert the sort order of list-log in cgi scripts.
	This change to cgi-bin/common should be upward compatible because
	it is controlled by additional parameters to the Perl functions.
    Complain about contradictory or ignored entries in whitelists, including
	"from" checksums that are normally ignored in server whitelists.
    Fix dccd craziness with gre (or any) interfaces with the same IP addresses
	as other interfaces observed Craig Green.
    Fix infinite loop in dccproc triggered by a To: header of more than
	20480 bytes and with a '\n' character in byte #20478 observed by
	James McNutt.
    Ignore a few failures by select() apparently caused by SOCKS libraries.
    Increase default DNSBL timeouts to -Bset:msg-secs=40 and -BURL-secs=11

1.3.20
    Fix dbclean expiration of reputation checksums

1.3.19
    Changed the midnight dccm and dccifd system log message to disclose
	spam passed from whiteclnt-listed MX servers.
    MX servers should now be listed in /var/dcc/whiteclnt with lines like:
		mx	ip	10.2.3.4
		mx	ip	10.5.6.0/28
		mxdcc	ip	10.7.8.9
	"MX" marks the IP address of one of your mail systems that should
	be ignored in initial Received: headers and when reported by
	sendmail to dccm.  "MXDCC" marks IP addresss of your mail systems
	that run DCC clients and that will have already reported mail
	to the DCC.  Continue using "OK" whitelist entries for mail systems
	that you trust to never send or forward unsolicited bulk email.
    Allow custom DNS blacklist SMTP rejection messages.  See
	-Bset:rej-msg=X in the dccifd and dccm man pages.

1.3.18
    Fix `dccm -aIGNORE` crash reported by Juergen Georgi.
    Fix detection of duplicates reputation reports.
    Initial support for "mx ip" entries in whiteclnt files.
    Fix compression by dccd of delayed reputation reports.

1.3.17
    People have broken wget by changing the old "--non-verbose" to
	"--no-verbose". That would have ok, except they do not understand
	what they were doing enough to support the old form.  Reportedly
	"-nv" works on both versions.
    `cdcc stats` on DCC Reputation servers includes an additional line
	about reputation results.
    Adjust logged reason when spam is ignored after greylist as suggested
	by Spike Ilacqua.
    Replace `dccproc -R` with `dccproc -r N`  (Of course, `dccproc -R`
	is still recognized.)
    Fix problems with flooding and expiring bad reputations with modest
	evidence.

1.3.16
    Fix bug introduced in 1.3.15 that caused greylist retransmissions
	to be counted by the DCC server as separate messages contributing
	to the "bulkness" of a message.
    If /var/dcc/log is neither readable nor searchable by 'other', then
	create log files with the same 'group' permissions as the directory
	instead of the old default of 600.  This allows the application of
	cgi scripts to the main whiteclnt and log files.
    `dccd -T ALL` no longer works.  It never made much sense and continues
	to cause confusion.
    Dccifd in proxy mode no longer requires blanks after colons in SMTP
	commands.  Problem reported by Martin Pala.
    Fix dccifd proxy mode crash on mail messages without bodies reported
	by Martin Pala.
    Complain about bad host name and other errors in whiteclnt files
	every 30 minutes instead of every 5 minutes.
    Allow whiteclnt files to be read-only with a new locking scheme.
    Use Milter.macros.eom in sendmail 8.13 so that the ${dcc_isspam}, and
	${dcc_notspam}, ${dcc_userdir} macros can be set by sendmail.cf
	rules that examin headers.  This might also allow some hack_mc
	settings to be used with delay_checks.
    As suggested with discussions with Martin Pala, the thresholds for
	quick flooding among servers are now non-linear.

1.3.15
    When "option MTA-first" in a dccm and dccifd whiteclnt file, determinations
	of (not) spam by the MTA are consulted first and so can be overidden
	by the whiteclnt files.  This allows individual	users to override a
	sendmail access.db file.
    Correct the SMTP rejection message in per-user log files for dccm and
	dccifd, especially when dccifd is acting as a proxy.
    Fix bug reported by James Carlson that kept./configure from turning
	on SOCKS.
    Make "option dcc-reps-on/off" and "option dcc-on/off" independent.
	A mailbox can now use neither, either, or both of DCC Reputations
	and standard DCC filtering.
    Use distinct timestamps on reputation reports so they won't be seen
	as duplicates by flooding peers.

1.3.14
    Keep dccd flooding threshold at or above 10.
    Fix dccd core dump involving reputation counts in 1.3.13.

1.3.13
    Make default maximum server memory size 2000 MByte on all except IRIX
	and Solaris.
    Fix bug in 1.3.12 that causes dccd flooding thresholds to be 0 if
	dccd is started by hand or without a dccm rejection threshold.

1.3.12
    Fix packaging error in 1.3.11.

1.3.11
    Dccproc should complain if the -w whiteclnt file is bad.
    misc/dcc.m4 can add a sendmail.cf rule that assigns a single
	whiteclnt file and log directory to mail forwarded to another system.
	With that the cgi-bin scripts can be used to control dccm for
	mail forwarded to another system with a single web user.

1.3.10
    Delete "message" checksum in greylist database when spam causes
	an embargo to be restored.  This fixes some counts after a
	greylist whitelisting has been revoked.
    Make the default owner and group for files be root:wheel on FreeBSD
	As always, use the DCC_OWN and DCC_GRP environment variables with
	`make install` or updatedcc -e to override those defaults.

1.3.9
    Dccifd and dccproc treat the bogus SMTP client IP address of 0.0.0.0
	from SpamAssassin as if it were absent, which allows it to look in
	in Received headers.
    Add "rcvd-nxt" option to the dccifd MTA protocol to parse later
	Received: headers.

1.3.8
    Repair greylisting broken in 1.3.7.

1.3.7
    Fix "bulk rep" string in X-DCC header.
    Many other reputation related changes.
    Log files now say "Restore #x" instead of "Embargo #x" when a greylist
	embargo is restored because the message is spam.
    Don't use -a with `fetch` in updatedcc, fetchblack, and
	fetch testmsg-whitelist because it does not know when to stop trying
	to reach a dead FTP server.
    Add "any" to dccm, dccifd, and dccproc -B DNSBL result address as
	suggested by Giulio Cervera.

1.3.6
    Compute reputations of IP addresses.
    Try to deal with UNIX kernel problems cause bogus failures of mmap().
    Fix bug related to --disable-dccifd reported by Krzysztof Snopek.
    Stop relying on `su - -c` to start daemons as requested by Dean Hollister.
    Fix server-ID mapping in /var/dcc/flod to use the first relevant mapping
	as the documentation says instead of the last one.
    Fix recent bug in cron-dccd that stopped emptying client per-user log
	directories.

1.3.5
    Untangle `dccd -a` as well as local host name and IPv4 vs. IPv6 options
	in /var/dcc/flod
    Fix automatic /var/tmp/map file upgrading for Windows.
	Actually c:\\program files\dcc\map
    Improve dccd work-around for missing /var/dcc/libexec/cron-dccd cron job
	on memory-short DCC servers.  This still not a substitute for the
	cron job.  *USE THE CRON JOB*.
    Repair dccifd and dccm midnight log entry bug reported
	by Christopher Bodenstein.
    Fix recent bug in cron-dccd that stopped emptying /var/dcc/log.

1.3.4
    Fix another dccm, dccifd, and dccproc bug related to bogus long
	URLs from a core dump on Spike Ilacqua's system.
    Fix installroot homedir/Makefile as suggested by Pavel Urban and Paul Ganci.
    Add `cdcc "src x.y.z.w" to help DCC clients navigate firewalls.
	This change requires a change in the format of the /var/dcc/map file.
	However, the DCC clients should all automatically and invisibly
	upgrade old files.
    Fix `dccd -a` bug reported by John Levine.`

1.3.3
    Work around bogus use of "::" in line 184 of /usr/share/mk/bsd.lib.mk"
	in ancient FreeBSD as reported by Lento Yip.

1.3.2
    Improve logging of failures by external filters.
    Fix new use of pstat_getstatic() on HP-UX to obtain physical memory size.

1.3.1
    Allow dccproc, dccm, and dccifd to use an external filter.  See the
	./configure --with-xfltr=FILE --with-xfltr-cflags=opt and
	--with-xfltr-ldflags=opt, the discussion of -X in the man pages,
	and the toy filter in thrlib/xfltr_sample.c.
	See also /var/dcc/dcc_conf-new
    Automatically decrease the number of DNS blacklist helper processes for
	dccm and dccifd when fewer are needed.
    Use pstat_getstatic() on HP-UX to determine the size of physical memory.
    Dccifd refuses to run on HP-UX 11.00 to keep SpamAssassin from stalling
	while dccifd cannot hear.

1.3.0
    New license.
    cron-dccd tells dbclean -6 if needed.
    Treat EHOSTUNREACH or "No route to host" like ECONNREFUSED in DCC
	clients and do not complain about every instance.
    Deal better with DCC servers with floppy multi-homing such as behind
	some NAT boxes.
    Deal more gracefully with Linux systems without IPv6 support but
	with `cdcc "IPv6 on"`.
    Fix crash in dccm, dccifd, and dccproc while computing FUZ2 checksum on
	URLs with very long host names in HTML mail messages.
    Fix dccifd missing SMTP reply code in dccifd rejections in proxy mode.
    `dccifd -ddd` logs SMTP transactions in proxy mode.
    Dccifd man page has example -o configuration for use as a Postfix
	before-queue filter.
    Restart dccm and dccifd after core dumps.

1.2.74
    Make clients prefer real IPv6 address to embedded or mapped IPv4
	addresses.

1.2.73
    Fix crash in dccsight as suggested by Vincent Schonau.
    Fix handling of log files for senders without reverse DNS in
	cgi-bin/common as suggested by Vincent Schonau.
    Add IPv4 and IPv6 o-opts to /var/dcc/flod lines to deal with the change
	in the default from "YES" to "NO" in the FreeBSD ipv6_ipv4mapping

1.2.72
    Do not make DNS blacklist checks if the MTA already knows the message
	is or is not spam.
    Add -lresolv to $LIBS for Mac OS X Darwin as suggested by Joel Brogniart.
    Change DNS blacklist checking to check MX servers as well.
    Add -B settings to control which DNS blacklists are used for the envelope
	or body, and whether MX servers should be checked.
    SIGUSR1 causes dccm and dccifd to send their statistics to the system log.
    Use getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() when getipnodebyname() and
	getipnodebyaddr() are not available.  This might make IPv6 work
	on Linux systems.
    Note that to make dccd listen to IPv6, -6 must be added to DCCD_ARGS
	and GREY_DCCD_ARGS in /var/dcc/dcc_conf.  This requirement has long
	been present to defend against systems that only pretend to
	understand IPv6.  Perhaps it is time to remove it.
    Add `dccifd -o` to use a subset of ESMTP so that dccifd can be used
	as a "before-queue" filter or SMTP proxy by Postifx.
    Probably fix a rare dccm and dccifd crash.

1.2.71
    Fix stray greylist queries reported by Vincent Schonau.
    Fix conflict between checking DCC and greylist servers on Linux
	reported by Vincent Schonau.

1.2.70
    Turn on IP TOS bits for DCC server-to-server flooding.
    Add -B to dccproc, dccm, and dccifd to consult DNS blacklists.
	This feature and greylisting are valuable supplements
	to DCC target counting.  However, greylisting is generally
	significantly better where greylisting can be used.  Most
	dccproc and many dccifd installations cannot use greylisting.

1.2.69
    Add `misc/hackmc -r` like -R but to reject instead of discard bad
	relay attempts.
    Fix bogus X-DCC header added after a fatal problem with the DCC server
	as suggested by Harald Daeubler.
    Release a single tarball equivalent to the old dcc-dccd-*.tar.Z that
	contained the DCC server and all clients.

1.2.68
    Fix counting of blacklisted DCC clients by dccd.

1.2.67
    Remove bonehead optimization in dccd of /var/dcc/blacklist in 1.2.66.
    Deal with stdargs in gcc 3.4 on AMD 64-bit systems that do not allow
	a va_list arg to be passed to two different subfunctions, but
	without breaking things on the many systems that lack va_copy().

1.2.66
    Overhaul dccd rate-limiting.  Instead of imposing a penalty time
	on overactive clients, simply rate-limit them.
    Reduce limit on dccd error messages about clients from 2/second to
	0.1/second.

1.2.65
    Fix accounting of NOPs from blacklisted clients.
    Fix race that caused "??" server-IDs in X-DCC headers.
    Do not count requests from blacklisted clients against the rate limits
	as suggested by Sven Willenberger.

1.2.64
    Correct ">XXXX clients" from `cdcc stats`
    Removed redundant declarations of mapfile_nm and rl_anon as
	suggested by Andreas Jochens.

1.2.63
    Possibly fix dccm crash reported by Ludger Bolmerg.

1.2.62
    Fix bug in `dccd -a10.2.3.4` diagnosed by John Levine.

1.2.61
    Fix file descriptor leak in getifaddrs() replacement.

1.2.60
    Fix bug reported by John Levine on systems such as BSD/OS 4.3
	without getifaddrs() introduced in 1.2.59 with tracking changes
	in network interfaces.

1.2.59
    Fix broken `dccd -G0` reported and diagnosed by Chris Mikkelson.
    Track changes in network interfaces on most modern flavors of UNIX
	as suggested by James Carlson.
    Fix two MIME decoding bugs as suggested by George Schlossnagle.
    Treat '>' as a blank instead of punctuation for FUZ2 checksums.
    Don't re-use va_list in stdargs functions to work around a characteristic
	of gcc for AMD 64 bit systems.  gcc 64-bit stdargs
	reportedly passes va_list by reference instead of by value.
    Fix date labels in graphs generated by dcc-stats-graph as suggested by
	Kevin Gagel.

1.2.58
    Work around new bug in FreeBSD 4.10 mechanism to disconnect UDP
    sockets reported by Daniel V Klein.  The symptom of the bug is
    that DCC servers appear down to clients running on FreeBSD 4.10

1.2.57
    Invoke WSACleanup() after using WSAStartup() on Windows systems
    as suggested by Carl Stehle.

1.2.56
    Fix /var/dcc/ids delay= extension.

1.2.55
    Add `./configure --with-max-db-mem=X` to limit the size of the
	database window.
    Extend /var/dcc/ids format to allow authenticated clients to be delayed
	as `dccd -U` delays anonymous clients.
    Add `./configure --with-kludge=FILE`.

1.2.54
    Fix problem with flooding among greylist servers using `dccd -Gweak-IP`
	reported by Valentin Chopov.

1.2.53
    Restore `dccsight -G grey-cksum` because the proof-of-concept CGI
	scripts use it.
    On OS X, use owner and group of daemon:daemon for programs and use
	dccmaninstall in `make install` as suggested by Jason Schwarz.

1.2.52
    Fix problem in start-dccm and start-dccifd with Solaris /bin/sh
	reported by Gary Mills
    Work around bug in OpenBSD HTONL() and NTOHL() reported by Jeff Drinkert.
    Change wlist to rebuild the .dccw hash table unless given -Q.

1.2.51
    Fix cause of "packet length 44 too small" complaints by DCC servers.
	With an empty mail body and no useful headers, DCC clients were
	sending empty requests to DCC servers.
    Add `cdcc "debug TTL=x"` to help find firewalls that filter DCC requests.
    Use shared libmilter.so in dccm as suggested by James Carlson.
    Fix Body checksum when MIME boundary crosses buffer boundary from
	Richard Lyons.
    Stop crash in dccm reported by Krzysztof Snopek.
    Deprecate misc/dccdnsbl.m4 and change misc/hackmc to work with
	FEATURE(dnsbl) and FEATURE(endnsbl) in modern sendmail.
    Make it compile on Mac OS X and DragonFly FreeBSD.
    Reduce the size of greylisting databases.
    Separate DCC query mode for dccm and dccifd from greylist query mode.
    Add `dccd -G weak-IP` to whitelist not only a {sender,target,IP address}
	after passing the greylist embargo, but anything from the IP address.
	Use this facility with caution; it might be a bad idea.

    The last change requires that all greylist clients and servers
	be upgraded simultaneously.

1.2.50
    Fix `dccifd lhost,lport,rhost/bits` on systems that have IPv6.
    Change homedir/make-dcc_conf to track changes in
	`./configure --with-rundir=x --libexecdir=y`
	as suggested by Josef T. Burger.  This change will not be effective
	until upgrading from 1.2.50 to later versions.
    Deal with tiny FD_SETSIZE reported by Christian Becker.
    Fix dccifd, dccm, and dccproc core-dump caused by missing whiteclnt file
	reported by Henrik Edlund.

1.2.49
    Fix infinite loop in computing DCC clients computing checksums of
	large, deeply nested MIME messages reported by Clive Cleland.

1.2.48
    Add "option dcc-off" and "option dcc-on" to per-user whitelist files
	as suggested by Spike Ilacqua.
    Make /var/dcc/libexec/fetch-testmsg-whitelist deal with cron processes
	that set $PATH without /usr/local/bin

1.2.46
    Fix infinite packet flood from DCC clients including dccproc observed
	by Benji Spencer, Clive Cleland, and Andrew Kent.  I introduced
	this serious bug with the WIN32 changes in 1.2.33.
    Fix "option greylist-off" bug introduced in 1.2.39 and reported by
	Spike Ilacqua.
    Defend dccd against too many clients.

1.2.45

	on systems with less than 512 MByte.
    Fix `cdcc "stats all"` to use the right host name from Leandro Santi.
    Increase `dccd -R` default rate limits for all anonymous clients
	and for individual authenticated clients..
    updatedcc understands -V x.y.z unless no old version x.y.z is available.

1.2.44
    Fix bug in dbclean -e and -E default reductions that made them 50% less
	instead of more conservative compared to 1.2.39.
    Speed up dbclean on systems with mmap(MAP_ANON).
    Clean some uninitialize variable complaints from purify reported by
	Praveen Nimmagadda.
    Minor adjustments to deal with Solaris's VM system.

1.2.42
    More adjustments to deal with Solaris's VM system.
    Use all except 384 MByte of physical memory on systems with more than
	768 MByte.  On systems with 768 MByte or less, use half.
    Tweak WIN32 makefiles.

1.2.41
    Restore TZ in update/misc after setting it to GMT to keep the
	Solaris FTP from going crazy.

1.2.40
    Include win32.makin2 that was missing from 1.2.39.
    Do not respond to clients when the database is broken to ensure that
	they switch to another server.
    Add missing "option greylist-on" support to cgi-bin/edit-whiteclnt
    Remove DCC_PROTO_HOMEDIR support for building RPM or other packages
	and add `./configure --installroot=DIR`
    Adjust threshold for `dbclean -F` to keep Solaris systems from spending
	hours in dbclean.
    Add `dbclean -f` to turn off default `dbclean -F` on Solaris for
	installations where the file system has been tuned for the
	large, randomly accessed file that is a DCC database.

1.2.39
    Suppress syslog messages from cdcc noted by Krzysztof Snopek.
    Suppress complaints about madvise(MADV_WILLNEED).
    Tweak WIN32 porting aids.

1.2.38
    Turn off the use of madvise(MADV_WILLNEED) on systems such as BSD/OS
	that claim to have it but don't.
    -Gweak did not in 1.2.37 work as reported by Valentin Chopov.

1.2.37
    Tweak WIN32 #ifdefs.
    Change -G for dccm and dccifd to require -Gon.   Add kludges in
	start-dccm and start-dccifd to convert the old -G to -Gon.
    Add "-G noIP" and '-G IPmask/xx' to ignore all or part of the SMTP
	client IP address in the greylist triple.
    `dblist -G` no longer works.  Use `dbclist -Gon`
    Fix bug where dbclean increased the number of reasons to stop flooding
	by 1 and then decreased it by 2 reported by Bernard Gardner.
    Use madvise(WILLNEED) for database buffers on systems with plenty
	of RAM as suggested by Robert Milkowski.
    Adjust scripts including /var/dcc/libexec/start-dccd to deal with
	POSIX compliance of `expr` in FreeBSD 5.1.
    Change FUZ2 checksum to know about Polish.

1.2.36
    Fix updatedcc for systems that have only make in $PATH but where
	it is really gmake.

1.2.35
    Turn off the use of poll() instead of select() on Linux systems.

1.2.34
    Fix bugs in the  ./configure mechanisms to use poll() instead of
	select() on FreeBSD reported by Valentin Chopov.

1.2.33
    Adjust default dbclean expirations based on available RAM and
	the size of the database.
    Make dcclib, cdcc, and dccproc build for WIN32 with Borland C++ 5.02
	or FreeCommandLineTools.exe.  The former can use the dcc.ide file
	and the latter can use win32.mak.
    Fix use of SO_LINGER on Solaris.
    More changes to ease compiling cdcc for WIN32.
    Possibly fix dccd amnesia about flooding peers.
    Use poll() instead of select() on FreeBSD.
    Fix updatedcc to use gmake if ./configure insisted.
    Entirely remove "--prefix" from ./configure to stop people from
	mistakenly assuming that ./configure is what the Free Software
	Foundation dictates it should be.
    Change /var/dcc/libexec/start-dccd to stop dbclean when dccd starts
	and so prevent a deadlock between dbclean and dccd.
    Fix problem with updatedcc on systems with only gmake reported by
	James Carlson.
    Fix problem with large greylist whitelist files reported by John Levine.
    Reduce number of write() system calls per operation in dccifd.

1.2.32
    Fix corruption of `dccm -U` directory introduced in 1.2.31 and
	reported by Spike Ilacqua.

1.2.31
    Make all dccd databases "big."  If you have not previously used
	`./configure --enable-big-db` then when version 1.2.31 of
	dccd is started, it will run dbclean to rebuild the database.
	This will make the hash table about 9% bigger and so 9% slower.
    Make the "ms" units optional for RTT adjustments in `cdcc add` or
	`cdcc load` as suggested by Hernan A. Perez Masci.
    Add ${dcc_userdir} sendmail.cf macro as suggested by Valentin Chopov.
	This lets you use the full power of sendmail.cf rewrite rules
	to control per-user whitelist and log directories.  See the
	dccm man page.
    Make `dbclean -F` the default on Solaris systems with plenty of RAM
	and automatically turn it off when there is not enough RAM to hold
	the entire database.

1.2.30
    Let `dccd -C` take arguments for dbclean, so that the following line
	in dcc_conf works:
		DCCD_ARGS="'-C$DCC_LIBEXEC/dbclean -F'"
    Make pthread_detach() failures in dccifd non-fatal.
    Add mechanism to cgi-bin/list-msg to whitelist-for-greylisting
	(sender,IP-address,recipient) checksums.  This mechanism
	requires that the 1.2.30 versions of dccd and dccsight be
	installed.
    Change dccifd to record the message headers in the log file even when
	the MTA fails to provide the message body.

1.2.29
    FUZ2 checksums character entity references in URLs in HTML.
    Insert checksums of greylist triples of whitelisted messages
	into the greylist database.
    If greylisting is turned on, then include greylist checksums in dccm and
	dccifd log files even for whitelisted and blacklist messages.
    Dccm and dccifd log some messages that are whitelisted for greylisting
	or otherwise not currently embargoed but were in the past.
    Change whiteclnt "log all-grey" and "log no-grey" options to
	"option greylist-log-off" and "option greylist-log-on".
	(Of course the old strings continue to work.)
    Add whiteclnt option "option greylist-off" and "option greylist-on"
	to control greylisting for greylistig for an individual user.
	Note mail in SMTP transactions that involve other users for which
	greylisting has not been turned off can still temporarily rejected.
    Add "option log-all" log everything for an individual user.
    The proof-of-concept CGI scripts handle the new whiteclnt options.
    Fix false "many" from dccproc when switching DCC servers reported by
	Rutger ter Borg.
    Remove 1.2.28 change in the dccd "xx MByte window" message that
	displayed the minimum of the physical file size and the mmap() window
	size.  The message now contains the mmap() window size..
    Fix `dccd -FG,` core dump reported by Aleksander Dzierzanowski.
    Make "skip asking" in `cdcc info` output a comment as suggested by
	Gunther Heintzen.
    Speed up flooding among greylist servers.

1.2.28
    Reduce the number of msync() system calls, significantly speeding up
	dbclean and dccd on FreeBSD.
    Fix "window" size computation for dccd and dbclean on systems with
	more than 4 GByte of RAM.
    Adjust flooding threshold for greylist dccd.
    Changed the dccifd man page to say that dccifd looks at the first
	Received: header for the sender's IP address if was not provided
	by the dccifd client.
    Remove the recommendation for whitelisting the Habeas Mark from the
	sample dcc_conf file.
    Detect bogus -G args reported by Aleksander Dzierzanowski.

1.2.27
    Use fsync() and msync() on /var/dcc/flod.map in dccd to try to
	get Linux to send the file to the disk.
    Use setsockopt(SO_LINGER) to speed shutdown on FreeBSD.

1.2.26
    Fix `dccd -F`.  Adding -F to DBCLEAN_ARGS in /var/dcc/dcc_conf on
	Solaris systems with enough RAM to hold most of the database
	can make dbclean twice as fast and reduces its effects on other
	processes.  Addcing -F to DCCD_ARGS might have similar effects.
    The use of MAP_NOSYNC on systems that support it including FreeBSD
	reduces the effects of dccd on other processes.

1.2.25
    Fiddle with /var/dcc/libexec/dcc-stats-graph.
    Add `dccd -F` like `dbclean -F`

1.2.24
    Generate /var/dcc/dcc_conf-new whether it is needed or not.
    Add `dbclean -F` to work around Solaris performance bugs with large
	files and mmap().
    Add `dccd -Gweak` to not require a retransmission of the same message
	to end a greylist embargo.
    Add option "no-reject" to the dccifd-MTA protocol to be similar to
	`dccm -aIGNORE` for greylisting while ignoring DCC results.

1.2.22
    Fix stray hostnames reported in dccifd log file headers observed by
	Chris Mikkelson.
    Fix empty dccm syslog complaints seen on Solaris.
    Fix core-dump with bogus hostname in whiteclnt file observed by
	Joe Ilacqua.
    Updatedcc starts to shut down dccd early to avoid problems restarting
	it on slow systems at the end.

1.2.21
    Fix dbclean every 20 seconds possibly observed by Kelsey Cummings.
    Stop frequent running of dbclean from dccd to clean up greylisting records.

1.2.20
    Fix cdcc core dump with non-existent /var/dcc/map files.
    Change updatedcc to not use "set -e" because some versions of
	bash have tantrums if you unset a variable that is not set.

1.2.19
    Fix "too many CIDR blocks" problem reported by John Doherty.

1.2.18
    Fix infinite loop in dccm reported by Gary Mills.  This error might
	also have caused dccm to crash.  It should affect dccd as well
	as the DCC client programs.  I introduced it in version 1.2.15.

1.2.17
    Fix IP whitelist entries in DCC server databases broken in 1.2.15 and
	1.2.16.

1.2.16
    Fix bug in libexec/updatedcc with blanks in CFLAGS reported by
	Aaron Paetznick.  This only fix uses of updatedcc after
	1.2.16 has been installed.

1.2.15
    Ensure the mtime of /var/dcc/whiteclnt.dccw files changes to stop
	endless reparsing on some Linux systems.
    Resolve inconsistency in dccproc whitelist vs. -t many noted by
	Dawn Endico by making whitelisting always produce an exit code of 0.
    Put absolute path on cdcc in misc/stats-get as pointed out by
	Kevin Gagel.
    Make dccm and dccifd log file size configurable as suggested by
	Furlan Campos.
    Fix bug reported by Jim Carroll that kept mail from being rejected
	when first sent to a spam.
    Allow large CIDR blocks to be white- or blacklisted in whiteclnt files.
    Fix dccifd -p bug reported by Christopher Bodenstein.
    Fix "continue not asking greylist" log message that should be
	"continue not asking DCC" reported by Jorg Bielak.
    Fix ./configure script in dccproc tarball that was creating a bogus
	RUNDIR value for dccifd.
    Add `./configure --with-max-log-size=KB` as requested by Furlan Campos.
    The proof of concept CGI scripts now
	deal with per-user logs for user that receive enough spam that their
	    log directories have 20,000 entries.
	support the per-user greylist log options for whiteclnt files
	    described in the dcc man page near the description of "include"
	support locking of per-user whiteclnt files with a line of
	    "#webuser locked"

    Fix greylisting of null messages.
    Add misc/fetch-testmsg-whitelist
    Improve compression/suppression of flooded checksums to reduce the
	database size and bandwidth requirements 10-50% for DCC servers that
	see fewer than 20K DCC ops/day.  Tests have produced conflicting
	results.  The full effects are not seen unless flooding peers
	install this version.

1.2.7
    Fix greylist flooding problem reported by Valentin Chopov.
    Add whitelists to greylist servers as requested by Bobby Rose.
    Change `dccm -r` to also set the greylist rejection message and to
	optionally interpolate the queue-ID and SMTP client IP address
	as requested by Gary Mills.
    Fix 1.2.x bug that treated all flooded checksums to a new database
	as stale until a local checksum has been added and dbclean run.

1.2.6
    Complete the fix for "badly signed NOP response" in the DCC server.
	To be effective, the public DCC servers will need to use
	version 1.2.6.

1.2.5
    Fix "badly signed NOP response" bug diagnosed by Philipp Buehler and
	Thorsten Janssen.
    Turn off connect() on DCC client UDP sockets for Linux 5.2.
    Use sysconf() on Solaris and Linux and sysctl() on BSD systems to
	estimate the size of physical memory.  This may reduce the need
	for `./configure --with-db-memory=X`
    Add `./configure --with-DCC-MD5` to use the MD5 code in the DCC source
	instead of any local library.
    Fix dblcean "repairing" the database because "was [it] not closed cleanly."

1.2.4
    Fix core dump in creating X-DCC header as suggested by James Carlson.

	deleting /dev/null when interrupted as suggested by Yury Razbegin.

1.2.3
    Fix leak in greylist server.
    Improve some obscure error messages from dccd.
    Address IPv6 problem on RedHat 5.2 reported by Darren Nickerson.
    Check /proc/meminfo on Linux for hints on real memory size to
	work around the Linux mmap() bugs and resulting dccd performance
	problems as suggested by Dave Lugo.

1.2.2

    Fix inflation of target counts on greylisted messages.
    Dccd is off in the default dcc_conf.
    Reduce default greylist embargo to 4.5 minutes.

1.2.0
    Many changes to support a form of Greylisting.
	See http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/
	and the dccd and dccm man pages.  Greylisting is probably not
	ready for prime time in 1.2.0.
    Change flod.map file format to allow `cdcc "flood stats 123"` to say
	"not connected since" as suggested by by James Carlson.
    Fix bogus "overwriting existing entry" error message noted by
	Dallas Engelken.
    As suggested by Leandro Santi, prevent false alarms about bogus packets

1.1.40
    Adjust client failure "fail_more()" backoff mechanism.
    Add commas to misc/dcc.m4 as suggesed by Spike Ilacqua.

1.1.39
    Fix missing changes to dcc.m4.

1.1.38
    Fix `make install` file ownership as noted by Gary Mills.

1.1.37
    Deal with certain obfuscating URLs.  This change includes some
	URLs in Fuz2 checksums and removes parts of some URLs from Fuz1
	checksums.  This should reduce much of the need for the dubious
	    many hex FUZ2: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
	whiteclnt entry.
    Decode RFC 822 and MIME entity headers to control quoted-printable
	and base64 decoding instead of the previous adaptive algorithm.
	This also involves decoding nested MIME multipart messages.
	A side effect of this is to change the checksums computed for
	some mail.
    Use poll() on Solaris to avoid failures from select() on large FDs.
    Smuggle the Mail_From value to dccm with a ${dcc_mail_host} macro
	so the mail_host checksum is valid despite sendmail smart relays.
	This requires rebuilding sendmail.cf with the new dcc.m4.
    Move part of the server-failing timer into /var/dcc/map so that
	dccproc processes can share it.
    Fix dccifd bug in handling detecting the end of headers reported
	by Tim Clymo.
    Fix `dccd -u` which was almost entirely broken.  Extend `dccd -u`
	to inflate the delay for busy anonymous clients.
    Make server selection more stable despite network problems.
    Fix some cases of false alarms of database corruption by dbclean.
	This fix is important where dbclean complains about `repairing` the
	database.
    Clear dccd queue delay when the server is idle.  This should help
	dccd on BSD/OS after dbclean runs.
    Avoid `chown` and `chgrp` with `configure --disable-sys-inst`.
    Add `dccproc -x exitcode` as suggested by Paul Wright.
    `cdcc clients` displays counts of NOPs to catch misconfigured firewalls
	at clients.

1.1.36
    Add optional DCCM_ENABLE and DCCD_ENABLE to /var/dcc/dcc_conf
    Look for libmilter.a where it is in some versions of Linux.
    Add "eval" to start-dccd, start-dccm, and start-dccifd when
	not using a separate UID to allow quoted blanks in
	`dccm -r "rejection messages"`.

1.1.35
    Deal with name space pollution in Solaris as suggested by Isaac Saldana.

1.1.34
    Fix libexec/dcc-stats-collect and libexec/stats-get as noted

    Reduce some stalling of dccd on BSD/OS when dbclean starts.
    Resolve conflict between start-dccifd and dccifd by making the default
	location for the dccifd PID file the same as for the dccm file
    Fix dccifd to remove stray X-DCC headers.
    Fix start-dccifd to pay attention to DCCIFD_ARGS in dcc-conf.

1.1.33
    Fix rare core-dump in dccd that more frequently corrupts the database.
    Do not loop forever as the result of some database corruption.
    Turn off by default dccd blacklist event tracing.
    Increase the limit on the size of white-listed CIDR blocks from /24 to
	/20 or 1024 IP addresses.  Every IP address whether specified
	separately or with a CIDR block requires a separate entry in a
	client DCC whitelist hash table.  The hash table is limited to
	about 80K entries.
    Add '-T' to misc/hackmc to trust or white-list mail authenticated
	by SMTP AUTH or START TLS.
    Server blacklisting suppresses "bad client or server-ID" error messages.
    add /var/dcc/libexec/stats-get produce server statistics as noted by
	Daniel Klein.

1.1.32
    Do not count MIME content-type image bytes when deciding whether
	to generate FUZ2 checksums.
    Unlink dccm and dccifd PID files before trying to (re)create them.
    Dccm watches milter "contexts" more closely for corruption.
    Add an optional count to `cdcc clients`.
    Dbclean tries harder to restore dccd flooding.
    Initialize wtgts in dccproc as noted by Leandro Santi.

1.1.31
    Fix core dump in ckfuz1.c noted by Gary Mills.

	Gary Mills.

1.1.29
    Fix dccm core dump in ckfuz1.c noted by Sven Willenberger.

1.1.28
    Fix dccm core dump in dcc_ck_body0() noted by Valentin Chopov.

1.1.27
    Add to HTML character references known by the Fuz2 checksums.

1.1.25
    Notice "Content-Type: text/html" headers to pay attention to HTML
	even in mail without <html> tags.
    Tweak the Fuz2 checksum to ignore some Microsoft delivery notifications.
    Adjust Fuz1 checksum to be more consistent on URLs.
    Fix date bug reported by Krzysztof Snopek in `cdcc clients`.
    Include an indication that the client was blacklisted in `cdcc clients`.
    Change MIME decoding somewhat as suggested by Leandro Santi.
    Fix bug in dccd client blacklist.
    Add `dccm -g not-all`.

1.1.24
    Add `cdcc "clients -s"` to sort by the number of requests.
    Add /var/dcc/blacklist of blocks of IP addresses refused by dccd.
    Remove -lpthread from $(DPADD) in dccm and dccifd Makefiles for Solaris
	with gmake to try to deal with problem observed by Krzysztof Snopek.

1.1.23
    Fix handling of &amp; in the middle of words in HTML.
    Change dccifd to respond with DCCIF_RESULT_REJECT or 'R' when
	queried about spam.
    Fix typo in detection of non-compiler on SunOS.

1.1.22
    Fix inconsistencies in fuzzy checksums computed by dccm and dccproc.
    More ./configure script changes to try to deal with problems on
	a Solaris system with GCC and some undetermined oddities.

1.1.21
    Suppress repeated messages about unauthorized server IDs of peers.
    Install cdcc, dccproc, and so forth in $HOME/bin by default
	if /usr/local/bin is not writable and $HOME/bin exists.
    Fix infinite loop in decoding invalid HTML character references.

1.1.20
    Fuzzy checksums ignore all text before initial MIME boundary and
	after terminal MIME boundary.
    Add support for Spanish thanks to Leandro Santi.
    Shuffle hostname resolving code to try to fix what may be a race
	in the Linux pthread_create() as discovered by Karl Grindley.
    Reduce default value of `dbclean -e` from 7 to 2 days.  Mail that does
	not reach the local bulk threshold within 2 days is probably not
	spam and if it is, it will almost certainly reach a bulk threshold
	at some other server in the network.

1.1.19
    fix missing env_From handling in dccifd/dccif.pl observed
	by Nathan Neulinger
    set mode of dccifd socket to 0666 as suggested by Nathan Neulinger

1.1.18
    fix `dccproc -c` logging bug noted by Brad Volz.
    fix ./configure to pick UID and GUID out of `id` with --disable-sys-inst
    multiply the `dccd -u` delay by 4 when flooding is off or broken to
	steer clients away from DCC servers without working links.
    radically reduce the number of wsync() calls to speed systems with
	lame mmap() support including BSD/OS 4.2.
    fix setting of file descriptor limit in dccm and dccifd as noted
	by Gary Mills
    change configure script to deal with change in gmake version string
	discovered by Aaron Paetznick

1.1.17
    add DCC interface daemon, dccifd, similar to dccm for SpamAssassin and
	Perl filters and MTAs other than sendmail.  This is only an initial
	release soliciting comments about its interface.  Its interface
	may change in 1.1.18.  The new lines of homdir/dcc_conf must be
	added to /var/dcc/dcc_conf to turn it on.
    `dccm -a IGNORE` says "would have rejected" in the log messages
	for Sven Willenberger
    generate sample client-ID password for localhost server in /var/dcc/ids
	and /var/dcc/map
    dccd only complains about unknown server-IDs when "IDS" tracing is
	turned on.
    DCC clients check for new server DNS records every other hour
	instead of every hour
    compute the same Base64 result for 32-character lines with or without '\r'
    close unlikely, theoretical per-user log file FD leak in dccm.
    dccproc passes header lines (including continuations) longer than
	20 KBytes
    fix bugs in misc/newwebuser as noted by Furlan Campos.
    dccm deletes all X-DCC headers of the right brand name to foil
	tricky spammers.
    dccproc defaults the -T tmpdir to the -l logdir

1.1.16
    fix long HELO values in dccm from Leandro Santi.
    fix /var/dcc ownership installation bugs noted by John Reames.
    let count of clients seen within 24 hours be more than 1000.
    change misc/na-spam, the news.admin.net-abuse.sightings gateway script
	to use dccproc log files instead of generating its own.
    don't allow ':' in DCC server "brandnames".
    recover misplaced change to misc/dcc.m4 to fix need to use
	FEATURE(`delay_checks')
    fix apparently harmless quoting error in dcc.m4
    fix `cdcc "flood stats all"` when the server's peers are not ordered
	by their IDs.
    decode Base64 with invalidly long lines.

1.1.15
    change graph generating shell scripts, including making the
	database size RRA use "MIN" instead of "MAX".  A shell script
	that can convert existing RRDs is available.
    make `misc/hackmc -O` apply to all uses of the sendmail access DB
	instead of only the envelope Mail_From value.

1.1.14
    tweak graph generating shell scripts.
    add `cdcc "flood stats all"` and `cdcc "flood stats clear all"`

1.1.13
    tweak graph generating shell scripts including fixes from Jack Bates.
    adjust autoconf mechanism to try to deal with systems with inet_ntop()
	but without IPv6.

1.1.12
    move dccd statistics to the flod.map so they're preserved despite
	restarting dccd.
    add shell scripts to generate RRD graphs.
    make rate-limits run-time parameters for `dccd -R`.

1.1.11
    fix dccm bugs with handling a non-responsive server.
    change misc/hackmc to modify sendmail.cf to reject unauthorized relay
	attempts with a temporary failure when they are supposed to be sent
	to the DCC but dccm is not running.  This prevents leaking relay
	relay spam.  You must use the new hackmc script to install this
	change in sendmail.cf.
    remove "# whitelisted" from `cdcc stats` output to give more room
	for totals.
    prevent empty dccproc log files as noted by Krzysztof Snopek.
    even fatal errors should cause dccproc to exit with 0 to avoid
	rejecting mail, as noted by Krzysztof Snopek.
    When server hostnames have common IP addresses, prefer the server
	with the non-anonymous client-ID, noted by Krzysztof Snopek.

1.1.10
    try to deal with truncated per-user dccm logs on Solaris.
    reduce threshold at which Fuz2 checksums are computed to capture
	more spam.
    force the use of gcc on Solaris.
    try not to wait for the syslog console messages to resolve a dccm
	crash on Solaris.

1.1.9
    make `cdcc "flood list"` unpriviledged, but disclose only server-IDs
	to strangers.

1.1.8
    fix "invalid database address" problems on SPARC systems with
	./configure ----enable-big-db
    %-encode quotes in URLs generated by the CGI scripts.
    fix `cdcc "id=X"` for X>65535.
    increase path length limit to 24.

    make the configure script again find the FreeBSD MD5 library.

1.1.5
    fix bugs in white-list links in the CGI scripts.
    increase 8-hop flooding path limit to 16.
    changes from Mark Moraes to compile dccproc under Cygwin on Windows 2000
    the DCC source compiles on OpenUNIX 8.0.1 thanks to Larry Rosenman.
    reduce the chances of duplicate or missing entries in the list
	from `cdcc clients` as suggested by Dave Lugo.
    add `dblist -C` to limit the listing to reports with specified checksums
	as suggested by Sam Leffler.
    `dccm -r "4xx ..." now produces a proper SMTP "temporary failure".
    deal with /usr/include/md5.h that seems to be RedHat 7.3 but that does
	not compile by itself.

1.1.4
    fix dccproc and dccm tarballs broken in 1.1.3.

1.1.3
    add a "VERSION:" string to the start of dccm and dccproc log files.
    fix memory leak in dccm observed by Gary Mills.
    fix core-dump in dccd with unreadable /var/dcc/flod noted by Sam Leffler.
    add prototype CGI scripts for per-user white lists.
    rate limit and improve log messages about read-only whiteclnt files.
    allow null passwords for server-IDs in /var/dcc/ids that are used only
	as markers so that no DCC server is accidentally started with the
	password "unknown"
    install initial /var/dcc/map file using dcc.dcc-servers.net
    install empty server database as suggested by Andrew Macpherson.
    create /var/dcc/log during installation.
    adjust the `dccd -u` default to minimize rejecting DCC queries from
	nearby anonymous clients.
    convert upper to lower case in dccm per-user white list directories as
	suggested by Andrew Macpherson.
    allow null passwords as place-keepers in /var/dcc/ids.
    rebuild gmake .d depend files when include/dcc_config.h changes so
	that bad things don't happen when a header file disappears and
	the configuration changes to match.
    fix "log-del" option in /var/dcc/flod to log checksum delete requests.
    add "del" and "no-log-del" options to /var/dcc/flod lines.
    change the defaults for flooding delete requests to log them ("log-del"),
	not send them ("no-del" among o-opts) and
	reject them ("no-del" among i-opts).
    change misc/hackmc to be usable in typical Makefiles that generate
	.mc files.  It now feeds a single set of .mc files to m4
	to produce a single .cf file on stdout instead of a set of .mc files.
	It also no longer includes ../m4/cf.m4
    use native sendmail milter libraries on FreeBSD 4.6
    IDs in /var/dcc/ids can be placeholders without passwords

1.1.2
    fix `dccm -W`.
    the recipient mailbox resolved by sendmail can be used as an white list
	value by dccm.  This simplifies white-listing when the system
	has more than one name.

1.1.1.
    add -follow to cron-dccd in case user log directories are beyond
	symbolic links.
    fix "resource temporarily unavailable" message from dccproc
	reported by Henrik Lewander.
    fix `dccm -W` problem in 1.1.0 reported by Mark Motley.

1.1.0
    "substitute" whitelist header entries must start with the name of
	the header.  This is incompatible with previous versions.
    remove `dccm -a REJECT_ONLY`
    add per-user whitelists and logs to dccm.  See `dccm -U`. Use the
	DCCM_USERDIRS variable in the new homedir/dcc_conf file to turn on.
	To generate per-user log files without leaking informatio about
	Bcc addresses, the format of all log files has changed slightly.
	Look for "bulk" in the X-DCC line instead of the final "targets" line.
    add `dccproc -E` to add dccm log file style envelope lines to log files.
    fix cleaning of hourly DCC log files as suggested by Gary Mills.
    X-DCC header lines contain the string "bulk" when the message is bulky.
    add the "mail_host" as a possible "subsitute header" for dccm.
    several of the mailing lists in the sample white list now require that
	dccproc or dccm use `-S sender`	or dccm use `-S mail_host`.
	This removes hostnames from the sample whitelist, because they
	can take a long time to resolve or fail to resolve.
    change env_To: lines in dccm log files to include the sendmail "mailer"
	and address.  Also add the resolved "mail_addr" and "mail_host"
	to dccm log files.
    allow common dccproc white list files owned by the DCC user to be in
	subdirectories of the DCC home directory instead of only the
	DCC home directory.
    use Rgethostbyname() in clients only when `cdcc SOCKS on` is sent
	and in the server only for flooding peers that are flagged with
	"SOCKS" in /var/dcc/flod.
    use gethostid() and hash the local host name instead of gethostbyname()
	to generate the DCC client host ID
    consider an entire report of checksums obsolete if the fuzziest checksum
	is obsolete for dbclean or flooding.  This reduces the database
	size and flooding bandwidth by another factor of 2.
    fix `./configure --mandir=/tmp/foo` to put the man pages into
	/tmp/foo/man8/dccm.8 and similar places on other systems instead
	of /tmp/foo8/dccm.8 as suggested by Michael Grant.
    add `configure --disable-sys-install` to simplify and make a non-system
	installation (e.g. by a user with a shell account) safer (no suid).
    stop frequent complaints about bad flooding passwords in most cases.

1.0.53
    fix bug in fuzzy checksums that was not handling long Base64 lines.
    increase the thresholds for computing the Body and Fuz2 checksums
	and decrease the threshold for the Fuz1 checksum.
    limit work-around for broken Linux threads that need signals delivered
	to the process group to Linux systems to avoid breaking dccm
	on Solaris 2.6 systems.
    add `cdccc "flood stats ID".  Part of this involves a change
	to format of the flod.map file.  It will be automatically rebuilt.
    fix `cdcc clients` and `cdcc stats` operations to do better with more
	than 64 active clients.
    fix core-dump in dccd found by James Carlson.
    use Rgethostbyname() when SOCKS is configured.
    fix private (not owned by the dcc user) whitelist files for dccproc.
    notice and report missing incoming flood connections.
    detect and complain about duplicate definitions in /var/dcc/ids

    generate dcc.m4 with the local choice for /var/dcc/run with configure.
    use dcc_inet_ntop() on systems that do not understand IPv6 to fix
	a problem on Solaris 2.6 discovered by Gary Mills.

1.0.51
    fix man pages on FreeBSD.
    fix file descriptor leak in dccd when using SOCKS.
    `cdcc "flood check"` forces dccd to re-resolve hostnames for flooding
	peers that are failing.

1.0.50
    Improve automatic dbclean-ing by dccd.

1.0.49
    Check the log directory for dccproc and dccm after changing to the
	home directory.

1.0.48
    Split old records in the database so they compress better.
    Reduce bandwidth required for flooding by summarizing checksum counts.
    Fix configure in the partial packages, dcc-dccm-*.tar.Z and
	dcc-dccproc-*.tar.Z
    Fix `dccd -K no-IP`.
    Fix error messages for `dccproc -c type,thold` and add "never" as in
	`dccproc -c all,never`
    Fix yet another bug in dcc_mkstemp().
    Add "NEVER" to -c for dccproc and -t for dccm.
    Enhance `dccm -l logdir` and `dccproc -l logdir` to scatter log files
	among directories for systems dealing with more than 500,000
	mail messages per day.
    Dccm log files are now named "tmp.XXXXXX" until it is known that they
	are needed and they are renamed to msg.XXXXXX or they are deleted.

1.0.47
    Make "-n brand" optional for dccd.
    decode Base64 before computing checksums.
    remove `cdcc pck` and `cdcc delck body` operations.
    add configure parameter --with-bad-locks to deal with Solaris mmap()
	vs. fcntl() locking problems.
    Dccm and dccproc shold keep only the last of several locally specified
	header checksums.
    Because people have been confused by env_To checksums being ignored
	in server whitelists, they are now reported as errors.

1.0.46
    Fix garbage in dccm log file names.
    When run as root, dbclean avoids changing the owner of the database files.
    Add logging to dccproc in the style of dccm.
    Accept hex checksums to allow whitelisting message bodies, and especially
	"empty" bodies contianing more than 1 KBytes generated by
	Outlook Express.
    Improve compression of old entries in the database.
    Add checking of "substitute" headers.  See -S in the dccm and dccproc
	man pages.

1.0.45
    Repair incoming flood duplicate detection broken in 1.0.44.

1.0.44
    Dccd now tries to fix the database when it starts
	dccd also marks the database potentially inconsistent while it
	is running and until it stops cleanly.  Graceless shutdowns
	are now detected and the database is automatically checked with
	`dbclean -R` before dccd resumes operation.
    Add Fuz2 checksums to the default lists along with Fuz1 and Body
    By default, dccd does not keep non-body checksums in the database.
	The previous behavior can be restored with -Kall.
    Double the maximum size of the database's hash table
    Teach dccd to run dbclean to expire checksums so things work even
	if the cron job doesn't
    Misc/hackmc -D adds a local rule to reject mail from SMPT clients
	without reverse DNS to the DCC
    Suppress messages from dccd for EINVAL the second connect().
	This is lame, but both FreeBSD and Linux answer the second connect()
	on a non-blocking socket after an ICMP Unreachable or timeout
	with EINVAL.
    Speed up dbclean for large databases
	It is only about 2.5 times faster on linux 2.2.14-5.0
	Large systems handling more than 200,000 messages/day should
	use --with-db-memory=500000000 or whatever is the appropriate number.
	This change combined with the -K changes mentioned above produce
	an overall speed-up of about 10 times for busy, not large systems.
    Add configure parameter --enable-big-db to support server databases
	with up to 2 billion instead of 16 million entries in the hash table
    Fix problem with env_To white-listing reported by Mark Motley
    Add -H to dccproc to emit only the header
    Fix dccd to pass -L parameters to dbclean so that log messages from
	automatic invocations of dbclean are not lost


1.0.43
    add prototype Fuz2 fuzzy body checksum and remove the subject checksum
	See INSTALL.{html,txt} about DCC_RPT_SUBJECT if you want to
	restore Subject checksums in in you DCC clients.
    fix SOCKS connection and re-connection of flood stream.
    add -c thresholds to dccproc and make its exit code indicate whether
	they are exceeded.  This should eliminate common needs to parse
	the output of dccproc.
    fix dccd iflod_send_pos() core-dump seen during very high network losses
	to flooding peer.
    deal with Linux bug in not allowing connect() after a previous

	the default behavior of dccd with multihoming.
    fixes for syntax errors in misc/{rcDCC,stop-dccd} from Michael Ghens
    make `dccm -W` less confusing.

    increase the number of checksums recognized by the server.
    fix pthread error on SunOS and possibly AIX.
    use absolute path for `cdcc` in /var/dcc/libexec/stop-dccd as suggested
	by Sam Leffler.
    improve fuzzy ignoring of MIME multipart boundaries.


1.0.37
    deal with lack of -s in SunOS `logger`.
    dccd now has a helper process to wait for slow DNS servers to resolve
	the names of flooding peers.
    Deleting and restarting the DCC server's database now causes dccd to
	ask peers to re-flood their checksums.  This new feature required
	changing the flooding protocol.  DCC servers using the new protocol
	talk to servers using the old protocol after the old servers start
	their streams or with an explicit tag in the /var/dcc/flod file.
    `sendmail -bs` is used by some mail user agents such as pine.  In such
	cases the sendmail milter interface gives filters such as dccm a null
	pointer to what should be an IP address and a pointer to the
	string "localhost".  Dccm now acts as if such mail arrived from
	IP address 127.1.  This makes the common white list entry
	"ok IP localhost" effective for such mail.  Note that dccm deletes
	X-DCC header lines with its own brand from white listed messages,
	because they would otherwise be wrong and a potential vulnerability
	to bad guys.
    Fix `dccproc -o ofile` to include the X-DCC header in ofile.  If this fix
	is a problem, see `dccproc -C`
    add /var/dcc/libexec/na-spam and ng-spam to gather spam from
	news.admin.net-abuse.sightings
    fix start-dccd, start-dccm, and cron-dccd to support multiple dccd
	daemons in separate home directories.

    add "log-del" option to /var/dcc/flod file
    fix recent damage to DCC{D,M}_ARGS in start_dcc{d,m}

1.0.35
    add DCC_LOG_FACILITY to dcc_conf as suggested by Sam Leffler.
	You must install the new homedir/dcc_conf with your parameters
	to use it.
    fix recently introduced bug that kept dccd from automatically
	running dbclean to expand the database.
    document the output of the dblist program in its man page.
    `configure --with-rundir` can be used to override the use of /var/run/dcc
	for the PIDs of DCC daemons, sockets, and so forth.

    look for sendmail for dccm in a FreeBSD "ports" package

1.0.33
    support for HPUX thanks to Richard Rauenzahn.
    check against "$USER" instead of "root" in start-dccm and start-dccd
	as suggested by Luke Crawford.
    make the server rate limits configurable at compile-time.

1.0.32
    fix bug in local white lists that ignored changes in the count field
    by default, start-dccm no longer tells dccm to reject based on
	message-ID checksums
    fix recently introduced bug that kept flooding off after the
	hash table needs to be expanded.

1.0.31
    add SOCKS support.
    dccproc only logs errors unless given -d.  This should fix problems
	in some mail systems using dccproc caused by network problems.
    fix permissions bugs related to using private map files
    the dcc_notspam sendmail macro used by dccm with -o must be non-empty
	to be considered "set".

1.0.30
    fix man page installation on OpenBSD.
    fix bug in starting incoming floods on systems with IPv6 interfaces
	but without what DCC recognizes as IPv6 support such as OpenBSD.
    deal with systems such as OpenBSD with lame mmap() support.
    speed up recognition of changes in the /var/dcc/flod file.
    use DCCM_REJECT_AT in /var/dcc/dcc_conf to also set the default
	flooding threshold used by dccd when it is started by
	/var/dcc/libexec/start-dccd
    add configure switches to not build dccm and the server
    `dccd -u` turns off `cdcc stats` from anonymous systems to avoid telling
	strangers how many mail messages a small DCC server has seen.

1.0.29
    fix start-dccd to deal better with non-standard DCC home directories.
    dccproc is now like dccm and treats a missing Message-ID header.
	as if it were present and with a null value.
    do the right thing for DCC servers running on platforms where
	gethostname() fails completely on a short buffer instead of
	giving a prefix of the hostname.
    detect and quit on null hostname from gethostname().

1.0.28
    improve the handling of an already running daemon in by misc/start-dccd
    support mapping of ranges of server IDs when flooding reports
    yet more changes to deal with quoted-printable.  These changes
	generally cause the fuz1 checksum to differ.
    remove need for FEATURE(delay_checks) when reporting sendmail access_db
	hits to DCC server
    change body checksum to ignore '>' in "\n>From" because the '>' is
	often added for old UNIX MUAs.
    improve response of dccproc to 20KByte or larger To: headers.
    make `cdcc "file map2; load map2.txt"` act the same as

    if dccm is already installed, try to build it even if the sendmail
	milter library is not available to prevent silent failures to
	install new versions of dccm.

1.0.25
    fix confusion if a quoted-printable sequence overlaps a buffer boundary.
    do not give up on remote servers if a local server responds with
	an ICMP unreachable error.

1.0.24
    minimize interpreting '=' in a URL as quoted-printable to make dccproc
	and dccm compute the same fuzzy checksums more often.

1.0.23
    fix confusion in dccproc about whether an initial line of a message
	that starts with blanks is a continuation of the last header line

1.0.22
    fix infinite loop and packet spew from dccproc when the clock jumps
    backward or jumps forward more than 1000 seconds.
    fix syslog process name on Solaris and AIX
    `dccproc -R` picks IP address out of standard Received: lines

    make the sendmail {dcc_isspam} and {dcc_notspam} macros consistently
	override what dccm and the DCC server determine

1.0.14

1.0.12
    in dccm count two intead of one open file for each active job against

	the value of -j for dccm and for automatically changing the soft
	resource limit.
    use the GNU autoconfig install script instead of `install -d` to create
	$(HOMEDIR)/libexec because GNU autoconfig does not detect install
	programs that do not understand -d
    rate limit complaints by dccd about unrecognized server IDs

1.0.11
    dccm tolerates null sender IP addres and hostname from `sendmail -bs`
	from sendmail 8.11.3 but perhaps not from 8.12.
    change -p for dccd and dbclean to -a to allow specification of entire
	server addresses.

	responses from the same IP address to which they send requests.

1.0.10
    fix "bogus oflod complaint length 0" nonsense from server
    `cdcc stats` counts the clients seen in the last 24 hours, but
