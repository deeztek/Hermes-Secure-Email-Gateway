.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Dccproc
is a low performance DCC client for checking single mail messages
for mail filters such as
.Xr procmail 1
.Pp
.Nm Dccproc
copies a complete SMTP message from standard input or a file
to standard output or another file.
As it copies the message,
it computes the DCC checksums for the message,
reports them to a DCC server, and adds
a header line to the message.
Another program such as
.Xr procmail 1
can use the added header line to filter mail
or the exit
.Nm
exit status.
.Pp
Error messages are sent to stderr as well as the system log.
Connect stderr and stdout to the same file to see errors in context,
but direct stderr to /dev/null to keep DCC error messages out of the mail.
The
.Fl o
option can also be used to separate the error messages.
.Pp
.Nm Dccproc
sends reports of checksums related to mail received by DCC clients
and queries about the total number of reports of particular checksums.
A DCC server receives no
mail, address, headers, or other information,
but only cryptographically secure checksums of such information.
A DCC server cannot determine the text or other information that corresponds
to the checksums it receives.
It only acts as a clearinghouse of counts of checksums computed by clients.
.Pp
The checksums of private mail, the internal mail,and other
mail that is known to not be unsolicited bulk can be listed in a whitelist
specified with
.fl w .
.Pp
When
.Xr sendmail 8
is used,
.Xr dccm 8
is a better DCC interface.
.Xr Dccifd 8
is more efficient than
.Nm
because it is a daemon, but that has costs in complexity.
See
.Xr dccsight 8
for a way to use previously computed checksums.
.Ss OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl V
displays the program's version.
Two or more
.Fl V
options show the options with which it was built.
.It Fl d
enables debugging output from the DCC client software.
Additional
.Fl d
options increase the number of messages.
One causes error messages to be sent to STDERR as well as the system log.
.It Fl A
adds to existing X-DCC headers in the message
instead of replacing existing headers
of the brand of the current server.
.It Fl P
The SpamAsassin DCC.pm plugin should watch for "bulk" in X-DCC SMTP header
fields, but historically has looked for counts of "many".
However, there are situations when
.Nm
knows that a mail message is extremely bulky and probably spam.
For example, mail from a sender that is blacklisted in
.Pa whiteclnt
gets an X-DCC header that includes
.Em bulk .
To acommodate that bug in SpamAssassin, by default whenever
.Nm
generates an X-DCC header containing "bulk",
it also forces the
.Em Body
count to "many".
.Fl P
turns off that kludge and the
.Em Body
contains the count from the DCC server.
.It Fl Q
only queries the DCC server about the checksums of messages
instead of reporting.
This is useful when
.Nm
is used to filter mail that has already been reported to a DCC
server by another DCC client.
No single mail message should be reported to a DCC
server more than once per recipient,
because each report will increase the apparent "bulkness" of the message.
.Pp
It is better to use
.Em MXDCC
lines in the global
.Pa @prefix@/whiteclnt
file for your MX mail servers that use DCC than to use
.Fl Q
with
.Nm .
.Pp
Do not use
.Fl Q
except on mail that you know has been reported to a DCC server.
DCC depends on reports of all except known private mail and
works only because almost no DCC installations use
.Fl Q .
.It Fl C
outputs only the X-DCC header
and the checksums for the message.
.It Fl H
outputs only the X-DCC header.
.It Fl E
adds lines to the start of the log file turned on with
.Fl l
and
.Fl c
describing what might have been the envelope of the message.
The information for the inferred envelope comes from arguments including
.Fl a
and headers in the message when
.Fl R
is used.
No lines are generated for which no information is available,
such as the envelope recipient.
.It Fl P
The SpamAsassin DCC.pm plugin should watch for "bulk" in X-DCC SMTP header
fields, but historically has looked for counts of "many".
However, there are situations when
.Nm
knows that a mail message is extremely bulky and probably spam.
For example, mail from a sender that is blacklisted in
.Pa whiteclnt
gets an X-DCC header that includes
.Em bulk .
To acommodate that bug in SpamAssassin, by default whenever
.Nm
generates an X-DCC header containing "bulk",
it also forces the
.Em Body
count to "many".
.Fl P
turns off that kludge and the
.Em Body
contains the count from the DCC server.
.It Fl R
says the first Received lines have the standard
"helo\ (name\ [address])..."
format and the address is that of the SMTP client
that would otherwise be provided with
.Fl a .
The
.Fl a
option should be used
if the local SMTP server adds a Received line with some other format
or does not add a Received line.
Received headers specifying IP addresses marked
.Em MX
or
.Em MXDCC
in the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file are skipped.
.It Fl h Ar homedir
overrides the default DCC home directory,
.Pa @prefix@ .
.It Fl m Ar map
specifies a name or path of the memory mapped parameter file instead
of the default
.Pa @prefix@/map .
It should be created with the
.Ic new map
operation of the
.Xr cdcc 8
command.
.It Fl w Ar whiteclnt
specifies an optional file containing SMTP client IP addresses and
SMTP headers
of mail that do not need X-DCC headers and whose checksums should not
be reported to the DCC server.
It can also contain checksums of spam.
If the pathname is not absolute, it is relative to the DCC home directory.
Thus, individual users with private whitelists usually specify them
with absolute paths.
Common whitelists shared by users must be in the DCC home directory or
one of its subdirectories and owned by the set-UID user of
.Nm dccproc .
It is useful to
.Ar include
a common or system-wide whitelist in private lists.
.Pp
Because the contents of the
.Ar whiteclnt
file are used frequently, a companion file is automatically
created and maintained.
It has the same pathname but with an added suffix of
.Ar .dccw .
It contains a memory mapped hash table of the main file.
.Pp
.Ar Option
lines can be used to modify many aspects of
.Nm
filtering,
as described in the main
.Xr dcc 8
man page.
For example, an
.Ar option spam-trap-discards
line turns off DCC filtering and reports the message as spam.
.It Fl T Ar tmpdir
changes the default directory for temporary files from the system default.
The system default is often
.Pa /tmp .
.It Fl a Ar IP-address
specifies the IP address (not the host name) of
the immediately previous SMTP client.
It is often not available.
.Fl a Ar 0.0.0.0
is ignored.
.Fl a .
The
.Fl a
option should be used
instead of
.Fl R
if the local SMTP server adds a Received line with some other format
or does not add a Received line.
.It Fl f Ar env_from
specifies the RFC\ 821 envelope "Mail\ From" value with which the
message arrived.
It is often not available.
If
.Fl f
is not present, the contents of the first Return-Path: or UNIX style
From_ header is used.
The
.Ar env_from
string is often but need not be bracketed with "<>".
.It Fl t Ar targets
specifies the number of addressees of the message if other than 1.
The string
.Ar many
instead of a number asserts that there were too many addressees
and that the message is unsolicited bulk email.
.It Fl x Ar exitcode
specifies the code or status with which
.Nm
exits if the
.Fl c
thresholds are reached or the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file blacklists the message.
.Pp
The default value is EX_NOUSER.
EX_NOUSER is 67 on many systems.
Use 0 to always exit successfully.
.It Fl c Xo
.Sm off
.Ar type,
.Op Ar log-thold,
.Ar rej-thold
.Sm on
.Xc
sets logging and "spam" thresholds for checksum
.Ar type .
The checksum types are
.Ar IP ,
.Ar env_From ,
.Ar From ,
.Ar Message-ID ,
.Ar substitute ,
.Ar Received ,
.Ar Body ,
.Ar Fuz1 ,
.Ar Fuz2 ,
.Ar rep-total ,
and
.Ar rep .
The first six,
.Ar IP
through
.Ar substitute ,
have no effect except when a local DCC server configured with
.Fl K
is used.
The
.Ar substitute
thresholds apply to the first substitute heading encountered in the mail
message.
The string
.Ar ALL
sets thresholds for all types, but is unlikely to be useful except for
setting logging thresholds.
The string
.Ar CMN
specifies the commonly used checksums
.Ar Body ,
.Ar Fuz1 ,
and
.Ar Fuz2 .
.Ar Rej-thold
and
.Ar log-thold
must be numbers, the string
.Ar NEVER ,
or the string
.Ar MANY
indicating millions of targets.
Counts from the DCC server as large as the threshold for any single type
are taken as sufficient evidence
that the message should be logged or rejected.
.Pp
.Ar Log-thold
is the threshold at which messages are logged.
It can be handy to log messages at a lower threshold to find
solicited bulk mail sources such as mailing lists.
If no logging threshold is set,
only rejected mail and messages with complicated combinations of white
and blacklisting are logged.
Messages that reach at least one of their rejection thresholds are
logged regardless of logging thresholds.
.Pp
.Ar Rej-thold
is the threshold at which messages are considered "bulk,"
and so should be rejected or discarded if not whitelisted.
.Pp
DCC Reputation thresholds in the commercial version
of DCC are controlled by thresholds on checksum types
.Ar rep
and
.Ar rep-total .
The DCC Reputations of IP addresses that the DCC database says have sent
more than
.Ar rep-total,log-thold
are computed and messages from those addresses are logged.
Messages from IP addresses with DCC Reputations of at least the
.Ar rep,rej-thold
rejection threshold can be rejected.
The DCC Reputation of an IP address is the percentage of its messages
known to have been sent to at least 10 recipients.
The defaults are equivalent to
.Ar rep,never
and
.Ar rep-total,never,20 .
.Pp
Bulk DCC Reputations do not reject mail unless enabled by an
.Ar option\ DCC-rep-on
line a
.Pa whiteclnt
file.
.Pp
The checksums of locally whitelisted messages are not checked with
the DCC server and so only the number of targets of the current copy of
a whitelisted message are compared against the thresholds.
.Pp
The default is
.Ar ALL,NEVER ,
so that nothing is discarded, rejected, or logged.
A common choice is
.Ar CMN,25,50
to reject or discard
mail with common bodies except as overridden by
the whitelist of the DCC server, the sendmail
.Em ${dcc_isspam}
and
.Em ${dcc_notspam}
macros, and
.Fl g ,
and
.Fl w .
.It Fl g Xo
.Sm off
.Op Ar not-
.Ar type
.Sm on
.Xc
indicates that whitelisted,
.Ar OK
or
.Ar OK2 ,
counts from the DCC server for a type of checksum are to be believed.
They should be ignored if prefixed with
.Ar not- .
.Ar Type
is one of the same set of strings as for
.Fl c .
Only
.Ar IP ,
.Ar env_From ,
and
.Ar From
are likely choices.
By default all three are honored,
and hence the need for
.Ar not- .
.It Fl S Ar hdr
adds to the list of substitute or locally chosen headers that
are checked with the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file and sent to the DCC server.
The checksum of the last header of type
.Ar hdr
found in the message is checked.
.Ar Hdr
can be
.Em HELO
to specify the SMTP envelope HELO value.
.Ar Hdr
can also be
.Em mail_host
to specify the host name from
the Mail_from value in the SMTP envelope.
As many as 8 different substitute headers can be specified, but only
the checksum of the first will be sent to the DCC server.
.It Fl i Ar infile
specifies an input file for the entire message
instead of standard input.
If not absolute, the pathname is interpreted relative to the
directory in which
.Nm
was started.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies an output file for the entire message including headers
instead of standard output.
If not absolute, the pathname is interpreted relative to the
directory in which
.Nm
was started.
.It Fl l Ar logdir
specifies a directory for copies of messages whose
checksum target counts exceed
.Fl c
thresholds.
The format of each file is affected by
.Fl E .
.Pp
See the FILES section below concerning the contents of the files.
See also the
.Ar option log-subdirectory-{day,hour,minute}
lines in
.Pa whiteclnt
files described in
.Xr dcc 8 .
.Pp
The directory is relative to the DCC home directory if it is not absolute
.It Fl B Ar dnsbl-option
enables DNS white- and blacklist checks of the SMTP client IP address,
SMTP envelope Mail_From sender domain name, and of host names in
URLs in the message body.
Body URL blacklisting has too many false positives to use on
abuse mailboxes.
It is less effective than greylisting with
.Xr dccm 8
or
.Xr dccifd 8
but can be useful in situations where
greylisting cannot be used.
It can be combined with greylisting.

.Ed
.Ar Domain
is a DNS blacklist domain such as
.Em example.com
that will be searched.
The strings
.Ar any ,
.Ar IPaddr ,
.Ar IPaddr/xx ,
or
.Ar IPaddrLO-IPaddrHI ,
specifies which IP addresses found in the DNS blacklist
after applying the optional IP address mask
.Ar IPmask
say that mail messages should be rejected or accepted with
.Fl B Ar set:white .
"127.0.0.2" is assumed if no address(es) are specified.
IPv6 addresses can be specified with the usual colon (:) notation.
Host names can be used instead of numeric addresses.
The type of DNS blacklist
is specified by
.Ar bltype
as
.Ar name ,
.Ar all-names ,
.Ar IPv4 ,
or
.Ar IPv6 .
Given an envelope sender domain name or a domain name in a URL of
spam.domain.org
and a blacklist of type
.Ar name ,
spam.domain.org.example.com will be looked up.
The names
spam.domain.org.example.com,
domain.org.example.com, and
org.example.com
will be looked up in blacklists of type
.Ar all-names .
Use
.Ar name
with DNS blacklists that use wildcards for speed
but
.Ar all-names
for other DNS name blacklists.
Blacklist types of
.Ar IPv4
and
.Ar IPv6
require that the domain name in a URL sender address
be resolved into an IPv4 or IPv6
address.
The resolved address from the mail message
is then written as a reversed string of decimal
octets to check the DNS blacklist, as in
.Em 2.0.0.127.example.com .
.Pp
A
.Ar domain
of "."
and type of
.Ar name
can be used to blacklist domain names with specified addresses.
This can be useful to detect URLs with domain names listed in
a Response Policy Zone (RPZ).
For example, the following can be used to reject mail
containing URLs listed by a response policy zone that maps
evil domain names to 224.0.0.0 with an informative status
message:
.Bd -literal
  '-Bset:rej-msg=5.7.1 550 %ID %BTYPE \\
	https://example.com/query/dbl?domain=%BTGT'
  -B.,224.0.0.0,name
.Ed
.Pp
More than one blacklist can be specified and blacklists can be grouped with
.Fl B Ar set:group=X .
All searching within a group of blacklists
is stopped at the first positive result.
.Pp
Unlike
.Xr dccm 8
and
.Xr dccifd 8 ,
no
.Ar option\ DNSBL-on
line is required in the
.Pa whiteclnt
file.
A
.Fl B
argument is sufficient to show that DNSBL filtering is wanted by the
.Nm
user.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl B Ar set:no-client
implies that SMTP client IP addresses and reverse DNS domain names should
not be checked in the following blacklists.
.br
.Fl B Ar set:client
restores the default for the following blacklists.
.It Fl B Ar set:no-mail_host
implies that SMTP envelope Mail_From sender domain names should
not be checked in the following blacklists.
.Fl B Ar set:mail_host
restores the default.
.It Fl B Ar set:no-URL
says that URLs in the message body should not be checked in the
in the following blacklists.
.Fl B Ar set:URL
restores the default.
.It Fl B Ar set:no-MX
says MX servers of sender Mail_From domain names and host names in URLs
should not be checked in the following blacklists.
.br
.Fl B Ar set:MX
restores the default.
.It Fl B Ar set:no-NS
says DNS servers of sender Mail_From domain names and host names in URLs
should not be checked in the following blacklists.
.Fl B Ar set:NS
restores the default.
.It Fl B Ar set:white
says the DNS list is a whitelist of names or IP addresses.

.Fl B Ar set:mail_host
.Fl B Ar set:URL
.Fl B Ar set:MX

.Ek
to group 1, 2, 3, or 4.
.It Fl B Ar set:debug=X
sets the DNS blacklist logging level
.It Fl B Ar set:msg-secs=S
limits
.Nm
to
.Ar S
seconds total for checking all DNS blacklists.
The default is 25.
.It Fl B Ar set:URL-secs=S
limits
.Nm
to at most
.Ar S
seconds resolving and checking any single URL or IP address.
The default is 11.
Some spam contains dozens of URLs and
some "spamvertised" URLs contain host names that need minutes to
resolve.
Busy mail systems cannot afford to spend minutes checking each incoming
mail message.
.El
.It Fl L Ar ltype,facility.level
specifies how messages should be logged.
.Ar Ltype
must be
.Ar error ,
.Ar info ,
or
.Ar off
to indicate which of the two types of messages are being controlled or
to turn off all
.Xr syslog 3
messages from
.Nm .
.Ar Level
must be a
.Xr syslog 3
level among
.Ar EMERG ,
.Ar ALERT ,
.Ar CRIT , ERR ,
.Ar WARNING ,
.Ar NOTICE ,
.Ar INFO ,
and
.Ar DEBUG .
.Ar Facility
must be among

.Ar KERN ,
.Ar LPR ,
.Ar MAIL ,
.Ar NEWS ,
.Ar USER ,

and
.Ar LOCAL0
through
.Ar LOCAL7 .
The default is equivalent to

.El
.Pp
.Nm
exits with 0 on success and with the
.Fl x
value if the
.Fl c
thresholds are reached or the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file blacklists the message.
If at all possible,
the input mail message is output to standard output or the
.Fl o Ar outfile
despite errors.
If possible, error messages are put into the system log instead of
being mixed with the output mail message.
The exit status is zero for errors so that the mail message
will not be rejected.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is run more than 500 times in fewer than 5000 seconds,
.Nm
tries to start
.Xr Dccifd 8 .
The attempt is made at most once per hour.
Dccifd is significantly more efficient than
.Nm .
With luck, mechanisms such as SpamAssassin will notice when dccifd is
running and switch to dccifd.
