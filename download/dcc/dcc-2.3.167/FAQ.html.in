<DT><A NAME="what-is-it">
What is the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse or DCC?</A>
<DD>
The DCC or Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse is an anti-spam content filter
that runs on a variety of
<A HREF="INSTALL.html#Compatibility">operating systems</A>.
The idea of the DCC is that if mail recipients could compare
the mail they receive, they could recognize unsolicited bulk mail.
A DCC server totals reports of "fuzzy" checksums of
messages from clients and answers queries about the total counts
for checksums of mail messages.
<P>
See the main <A HREF="dcc.html">DCC man page</A> as well as the
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/#overview">DCC web page</A>
and its <A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/#overview">mirror</A>.


<P><DT><A NAME="license">
Is the DCC source free</A>
<DD>
The non-commercial Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse source carries a
<A HREF="LICENSE">license</A>
that is free only to organizations that do not sell filtering devices or
services except to their own users and that participate in the global
DCC network.
ISPs that use DCC to filter mail for their
own users are intended to be covered by the free license.
You can redistribute unchanged copies of the free source, but you <B>may not</B>
redistribute modified, "fixed," or "improved" versions of the source
or binaries.
You also can't call it your own or blame anyone for the results of using it.
<P>
Organizations that do not qualify for the free license are welcome to
inquire about  licenses for the commercial version by email to
<A HREF="mailto:sales@rhyolite.com">sales@rhyolite.com</A>
or via the
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/cgi-bin/ct.cgi?sb=Commercial+DCC+License">form</A>.
The commercial version supports
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/reputations.html">DCC Reputations</A>.
<P>
Please note that organizations that do not qualify for the free DCC license
have never been allowed to use the public DCC servers.


<P><DT><A NAME="source">
Where can I get DCC source?</A>
<DD>
The official DCC source repositories are at
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/source/dcc.tar.Z">www.rhyolite.com/dcc/</A>
and
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/source/dcc.tar.Z">https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/</A>.
<P>
Please do not try to use ancient versions of DCC software dating from early
2005 and redistributed by third parties including some Linux packagers.
Those versions do not detect bulk mail as well as more recent versions.
Installations using those old versions also have problems using the
public DCC servers that often make it necessary to add their IP addresses
to the blacklist that protects the public DCC servers.
Even worse, all known Linux redistributions of DCC software have been
changed in ways that break things, including the
<A HREF="misc/updatedcc">@libexecdir@/updatedcc</A>
shell script that could
otherwise be used to fetch, configure, compile, install, and restart
a current version.
<P>
When installing DCC software, please consider the installation instructions
in the
<A HREF="INSTALL.html">INSTALL.html</A> file included with
the source or in the
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/INSTALL.html">on line source trees</A>.


<P><DT><A NAME="binary">
Where can I get DCC RPMs, packages or other binary forms?</A>
<DD>
There are no official distributions of DCC binaries,
whether simple a.out files, RPM Package Manager (RPM) packages,
or BSD style ports or packages (pkg).
There are many unofficial sources of DCC binaries, including
Linux RPMs and BSD style packages.
<P>
The FreeBSD packages are not too far out of date and
include a working version of the
<A HREF="misc/updatedcc">@libexecdir@/updatedcc</A> shell script that
fetches, configures, compiles, installs, and restarts
a current version.
<P>
As far as known in 2009, all DCC RPMs offered by Linux distributors
are based on DCC software from 2005 and <STRONG>should not</STRONG> be used.
They cause problems for the public DCC servers.


<P><DT><A NAME="fuzzy-personalize">
Do the fuzzy checksums ignore <Q lang="en-us">personalizations</Q>?</A>
<DD>
Yes, they ignore many <Q lang="en-us">personalizations</Q> and
<Q lang="en-us">hash busters</Q>.


<P><DT><A NAME="system-load">
How much bandwidth, RAM, disk space, and computing does the DCC require?</A>
<DD>
The UDP packets used by a DCC client to obtain the checksum totals
from a DCC server for a mail message generally use less bandwidth than
the DNS queries required to receive the same message.
A DCC client needs very little disk space.
<P>
Bulk messages are usually logged by DCC clients.
On systems receiving a lot of mail, the mechanisms for automatically
creating new log directories every minute, day, or hour
can keep any single log directory from becoming too large.
See the <A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-l">dccm</A>
and
<A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-l">dccproc</A>
man pages.
<P>
About 1.4 GBytes/day are exchanged between each pair of DCC servers.
Each server has 3 or 4 peers.
The resulting database is about 3 GBytes with the default expiration
parameters..
However, while <A HREF="dbclean.html">dbclean</A> is deleting old checksums,
there are three copies of the database.
The DCC clients and server do not need many CPU cycles,
but the daily executions of <A HREF="dbclean.html">dbclean</A>
on a system with a DCC server
require a computer with at least 2 or 3 GBytes of RAM.
In 2006,
a DCC server prefers more than 4 GBytes of RAM and can use 6 GBytes.
12 to 18 GBytes of disk space are also needed.
<P>
The memory found by <A HREF="dccd.html">dccd</A> or
<A HREF="dbclean.html">dbclean</A>
and how can be seen by starting them with -d in DCCD_ARGS or DBCLEAN_ARGS
<A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A> file in the DCC home directory.
They try to use half of physical memory if there is less than 2 GBytes,
all except 512 MByte between 2 GBytes and 4 GBytes,
and all but 1 GByte if there are more than 4 GBytes.
<P>
DCC servers used by clients handling 100,000 or more messages per day
need to be larger.
Each additional 100,000 messages/day need about 100 MBytes of disk space
and system memory, given the default expiration used by
<A HREF="dbclean.html#OPTION-e">dbclean</A>.


<P><DT><A NAME="need-server">Do I need to run a DCC server?</A>
<DD>
A mail system that processes fewer than 100,000 mail messages per day
uses less of its own bandwidth and the bandwidth of other DCC servers
by using the <A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/#public-servers">public
DCC servers</A>.
Each mail message needs a DCC transaction that requires
about 100 bytes, and so 100,000 mail messages/day imply about 10
MBytes/day of DCC client-server traffic.  Each DCC server needs to
exchange "floods" or streams of checksms with 4 other servers.  Each
flood is currently about 1.4 GBytes/day for a current total of about
3 GBytes/day.
<P>
When normally installed by the included Makefiles, DCC clients are
configured to use the
<A HREF="https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/#public-servers">public DCC servers</A>
without any additional configuration except opening firewalls to port UDP 6277.
<P>
Mail systems that process more than 100,000 mail messages per day
need local DCC servers connected to the global network of DCC servers.
The public DCC servers include denial of service defenses which
ignore requests in excess of about 240,000 per day per client.
<P>
It is wrong to resell the CPU cycles, network bandwidth,
disk space, and, most important, human system administration work of the
public DCC servers.
Vendors of "anti-spam appliances" or similar
that do not steal from the operators
of the public DCC servers have always run their own DCC servers.


<P><DT><A NAME="load-balance">
Can I use cluster or other load balancing mechanisms with my DCC servers?</A>
<DD>
No, <B>do not</B> try outside load balancing mechanisms with a DCC server.
Each DCC client must know the DCC server it is using for each DCC
request by fixed IP address.
Instead let the load balancing mechanisms in each DCC client work.
Each DCC client monitors the round trip time (RTT) including queue
delays to all of the DCC servers it knows.
The client uses the fastest available server.

<P><DT><A NAME="crash">
What happens to my mail if DCC breaks?</A>
<DD>
When in doubt or trouble, the DCC clients including
<A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A> and <A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A>
deliver mail.  They wait only a little while for a DCC server
to answer before giving up.  They then avoid asking a server for a while
to avoid slowing down mail.
<P>
If the DCC sendmail interface or milter program, dccm, crashes,
the default parameters in <A HREF="misc/dcc.m4">misc/dcc.m4</A>
for the sendmail.cf Xdcc line
tell sendmail to wait only about 30 seconds before
giving up and delivering the mail.
<P>
The DCC client code keeps track of the speeds of the
servers it knows about, and uses the fastest or closest.
Every hour or so it re-resolves A records
and checks the speeds of the servers it
is not using.  When the current server stops working or gets significantly
slower, the client code switches to a better server.


<P><DT><A NAME="mark-only">
How do I mark spam without rejecting it?</A>
<DD>
Unless given thresholds at which to reject mail,
<A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-t">dccm</A>
and
<A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-c">dccproc</A> do not reject mail.
When dccm is given a threshold by setting DCCM_REJECT_AT in
<A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A> in the DCC home directory,
DCCM_ARGS can also be set to <A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-a">"-a&nbsp;IGNORE</A>
so that spam is marked but not rejected.


<P><DT><A NAME="bad-man">
Why doesn't the man command find the man pages?</A>
<DD>
The nroff source, formated nroff output, and HTML versions of the
man pages are in the top-level source directory.
Formatted or nroff source is installed by default somewhere in /usr/local/man
depending on the target system.
It may be necessary to add /usr/local/man to the MANPATH environment variable.
Even with that, SunOS 5.7 sometimes has trouble finding them unless
<B>man&nbsp;-F</B> is used.


<P><DT><A NAME="sendmail-only">
Must sendmail be used with DCC?</A>
<DD>
While the sendmail milter interface, <A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A>
and the DCC program interface or <A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd</A>
are the most efficient ways to report and check DCC checksums,
<A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A> is also commonly used.


<P><DT><A NAME="postfix">
Can Postfix be used with DCC?</A>
<DD>
The best way to use DCC with <A rel=nofollow HREF="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</A>
is with <A HREF="dccifd.html#EXAMPLES">dccifd</A> as a
<A rel=nofollow HREF="http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_PROXY_README.html">Before-Queue Content

<P>

</PRE>
<P>
I think the warnings in the Postfix documentation about the costs of
Before-Queue filters apply more to computationally expensive filters
such as <A rel=nofollow HREF="https://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</A>
than dccifd.


<P><DT><A NAME="smtpd">
Can the DCC be used with smtpd?</A>
<DD>
Yes, <A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A> can be used with Obtuse's smtpd.
Dave Lugo has contributed a shell script to the
<A HREF="http://sd.inodes.org/">smtpd-sd project</A>
which can be used to do DCC checking prior to the end of the SMTP
DATA command.


<P><DT><A NAME="exim">
Can the DCC be used with Exim?</A>
<DD>
There are comments about using <A HREF="dccproc.html">Dccproc</A> with
<A HREF="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</A>
in the
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/pipermail/dcc/">DCC mailing list archives</A>
including these messages:

<LI><A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/pipermail/dcc/2002/000254.html">
2002/000254</A>
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>However</STRONG>, those mailing list messages talked about using
<A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A> before
<A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd</A> was available.
Dccproc is suitable only for low mail volumes.


<P><DT><A NAME="spamass">
Can the DCC be used with SpamAssassin or other spam filters?</A>
<DD>
The DCC can be used with
<A rel=nofollow HREF="https://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</A> as
well as other spam and virus filters.
Note that it is more efficient to arrange to use a DCC client daemon,
<A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A> or <A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd</A>,
to mark passing mail and check
<I>X-DCC</I> header lines in the filter than connect to
dccifd on each message.
It is even less desirable to start and run
<A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A> on each message.
<P>
If the <A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd</A> socket is present,
SpamAssassin prefers to talk to dccifd instead of running dccproc.
<P>
Some commercial virus and spam filters include DCC clients that
query public DCC servers or DCC servers operated by the filter vendor
and that "flood" or exchange bulk mail checksums with public servers.
Reputable manufacturers of such devices operate their own DCC servers
connected to global network of DCC servers instead of stealing and then
selling the CPU cycles, network bandwidth, disk space, and, most important,
human system administration efforts of the public DCC servers.

<P><DT><A NAME="dcc-delay">
How long must SpamAssassin or an MTA wait for DCC results?</A>
<DD>
DCC clients including dccproc, dccifd, and dccm can wait as long as
about 16 seconds for an answer from a DCC server.
Except when an anonymous client triggers the progressive delays that are
among the defenses against denial of service attacks in the public DCC servers,
delays are almost always less than 10 seconds.
Delays for DNS blacklists
(see <A HREF="dccifd.html#OPTION-B">dccifd&nbsp;-B</A>)
are additional.


<P><DT><A NAME="other-MUAs">
How can the DCC be used with mail user agents?</A>
<DD><A HREF="dccproc.html">Dccproc</A> can be used with any mail user
agent that can check mail headers.
For example, WD Baseley sent a
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/pipermail/dcc/2002/000212.html">note</A>
to the <A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/mailman/listinfo/dcc">DCC
mailing list</A>
on how to configure <A HREF="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</A> to
act on X-DCC header lines.
<P>
Bharat Mediratta has developed DeepSix for people using mail user agents
on UNIX boxes connected remote servers such as corporate Exchange servers.
See his
project on <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/deepsix">Sourceforge</A>
as well as his
<A HREF="https://www.rhyolite.com/pipermail/dcc/2001/000042.html">announcement</A>
in the DCC mailing list.


<P><DT><A NAME="root-needed">
Must I have the root password to use DCC?</A>
<DD>
No, the procmail or sendmail .forward DCC user program,
<A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A>
can be installed in an individual ~/bin directory.
Then <A HREF="cdcc.html">cdcc</A>
can create a private map file used with
<A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-h">dccproc&nbsp;-h&nbsp;dir</A>
or
<A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-m">dccproc&nbsp;-m&nbsp;dir/map</A>.
<P>
Also see the <A HREF="INSTALL.html#individual-user">DCC installation
instructions</A>.


<P><DT><A NAME="firewall-ports2">
Why don't the public DCC servers work?  Do I need a client-ID?</A>
<DD>
The public DCC servers accept requests from clients using the
anonymous client-ID.
Incorrectly configured firewalls often cause problems.
Traceroute can be used to send UDP packets to test for interfering firewalls.
See the answer to the <A HREF="#firewall-ports">firewall question</A>.
<P>
After firewalls, the most common cause of problems while trying to
use the public DCC servers is sending too many requests.
The DCC server daemon, <A HREF="dccd.html">dccd</A>, includes
defenses against denial of service or DoS attacks.
Those defenses include progressively delaying responses
and eventually ignoring requests.
The ancient version of the DCC client software included in some
Linux redistributions tries so hard to reach the fastest server
that it can trigger those DoS defenses.


<P><DT><A NAME="firewall-ports">
Which ports do I need to open in my firewall?</A>
<DD>
DCC traffic is like DNS traffic.  You should treat port 6277

TCP and UDP port 6276 is by the

DCC <A HREF="dcc.html#Client-and-Server-IDs">server and client-IDs</A>

Servers require server-IDs to identify each other in the floods of checksums

cdcc operations such as <A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-stop">stop</A>.
DCC servers require client-IDs to identify paying clients that should

You don't need and probably will not have a complete file unless you

A common cause of such problems is one of the DCC server's

A DCC server cannot know anything about anonymous clients,
or clients using client-ID 1 or without a client-ID and matching password
from the <A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-ids">@prefix@/ids</A> file.
As far as your server can know, an anonymous client sending many

<DD>
An easy way to test a DCC client whitelist or

is to feed dccproc with a test message.
For example, the following shell script would test whether the IP address
127.0.0.1
and the SMPT envelope Mail_From value postmaster@example.com are in the
<EM>whiteclnt</EM> file in the DCC home directory:
<PRE>
	#!/bin/sh

		-a 127.0.0.1 -f postmaster@example.com &lt;&lt;EOF
	Message-ID: <1234@example.com>

	text
	EOF
</PRE>
If the script produces something like
<PRE>
	X-DCC--Metrics: calcite.rhyolite.com; whitelist

then you know that SMTP client IP (mail sender) IP address 127.0.0.1
is whitelisted, but the SMTP envelope Mail_From value is not.


<P><DT>
Can I use wild cards or regular expressions in DCC
<A NAME="reg-exps1" HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">
whitelists</A>?
<DD>
No, regular expressions cannot be used,
because DCC client and server whitelists are converted to lists of checksums.
The same basic idea is used for DCC client whitelists
as for the DCC protocol.
A DCC client computes the checksums for a message, and then looks
for those checksums in the local whitelist.
Depending on the values associated with those checksums,
the DCC client asks a DCC server about them.
<P>
To use regular expressions with the DCC, consider procmail.
Procmail is included with many UNIX-like systems.
See also the
<A HREF="http://www.procmail.org/">Procmail Homepage</A>.
<P>
DCC clients can be configured to white- or blacklist
using called "substitute" headers.
See <A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-S">dccproc&nbsp;-S</A> or
<A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-S">dccm&nbsp;-S</A>.
<P>
It is also possible to use a sendmail access_db file entries to
white- or blacklist based on portions of SMTP envelope and
client IP addresses.
For example, an access_db file line of "From:example.com OK"
can be used to tell dccm to whitelist all mail from SMTP clients
in the example.com domain.
See the -O argument to the
<A HREF="misc/hackmc">@libexecdir@/hackmc</A> script.
<P>
It is generally better to use white- and blacklisting lines in
the global <A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">@prefix@/whiteclnt</A> file
or a per-user whiteclnt file.

<P><DT>
<A NAME="whitelist10">How do I whitelist mail from a legitimate

<P><DT><A NAME="incompat-whitelists">
Why does dccm or dccifd complain about "incompatible whitelists"?</A>
<DD>
There are several points during an SMTP transaction when an SMTP server
can reject a mail message.
Early points are when the SMTP client specifies the recipients of the
mail message.
The last point is after the entire message has been received by the SMTP
server.
Spam filters that check mail message bodies must wait until that last point.
The SMTP protocol does not allow an SMTP server to reject the
mail message for only some recipients.
The SMTP server must tell the SMTP client that the message has been
accepted for all or rejected for recipients.
This is a problem when the recipients of a single mail message have
differing
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">DCC thresholds or other parameters</A>
in their individual whitelist files
that require that the mail message be delivered to some mailboxes but
rejected for other mailboxes.
<P>
The DCC client programs solve this conflict in one of two ways.
One is telling the SMTP client
that the mail message has been accepted for all recipients and then
discarding instead of delivering the message for mailboxes with parameters
that make it spam.
This solution has the disadvantage of not informing senders of the
refusal to deliver the message.
The other solution is to temporarily reject recipients with possibly
incompatible parameters early in the SMTP transaction with the same
SMTP error status number as too many recipients for a single SMTP transaction.
This second solution has the advantage of ensuring that senders know
when their mail is rejected but the disadvantage of sometimes
requiring as many SMTP transactions as there are recipients for a mail message.
<P>
Which solution is used is determined by the
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">forced-discard-ok</A>
and <A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">forced-discard-nok</A>
settings in the global and per-user
<A HREF="dccm.html#FILE-whiteclnt">whiteclnt</A> files.
Unless all recipients for a mail message agree on the first solution,
perhaps by <EM>forced-discard-ok</EM> in the main
<A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">@prefix@/whiteclnt</A> file,
the second solution is used.


<P><DT><A NAME="whitelist4">
Why do legitimate mail messages have
<I>X-DCC</I> header lines that say they are "bulk", "many", or spam?</A>
<DD>
There are several possible causes of such problems.
The first and most obvious is that the mail is solicited bulk mail
and that the source needs to be added to your
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">whitelist</A>.

<P>Another possible reason is that your individual legitimate mail messages
have not been marked as spam because their <I>Body</I> or <I>Fuz1</I>
checksum counts are small, but that the IP address or other checksum
counts are large.
The IP address checksum count, for example, is the total of all reports
of addressees for that checksum.
That total is independent of the other checksums, and so counts
all reports for all messages with that source IP address.
A source of legitimate mail that has sent a message that was reported
as spam by one of its recipients will often have the totals
for the checksums of its IP address, From header, and
other values be <I>MANY</I>.
This is why it usually does not make sense to reject mail based on what the
DCC server reports for the IP address, From header, and other values that
are not unique to the message.
Only the last Received header line, the Message-ID line, and body checksums
can be expected to be unique and sometimes not the Message-ID
and Received header lines.

<P><DT><A NAME="qmail2">
Why is legitimate mail from someone using <I>qmail</I>
marked as spam?</A>
<DD>
A common cause for that and similar complaints involves
null or missing Message-ID header lines.
Spam often lacks Message-ID lines or has a null or "&lt&gt" ID,
so rejecting mail with null or missing Message-IDs can be an
effective filter.
DCC clients treat missing Message-ID lines as if they were present but null.
The sample <A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">@prefix@/whiteclnt</A>
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">whitelist</A> file in the DCC source
includes the line:
<PRE>
	many    message-id &lt;&gt;
</PRE>
Some Mail Transfer Agents violate section 3.6.4 of RFC 2822 and
do not include Message-ID header lines in mail they send,
including some combinations of qmail and
"<B>sendmail&nbsp;-bs</B>" acting as the originating MTA,
and qmail by itself when it is generates a non-delivery message or "bounce."
Solutions to this problem include removing that line from your
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">whitelists</A>
or adding lines specifying the From or envelope
from values of senders of legitimate mail lacking Message-ID header lines.

Are <A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">IP address blocks</A>
in <A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">@prefix@/whiteclnt</A> whitelists used by
<A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A>?
<DD>
Yes, <A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A> can whitelist mail
by the IP address of the immediately
preceding SMTP client,
but only if it knows that IP address.
Unless the <A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-a">dccproc&nbsp;-a</A>
or <A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-R">dccproc&nbsp;-R</A>
options are used, dccproc does not know the IP address.


<P><DT><A NAME="whitelist6">
Why is</A> <A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A> is ignoring
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists"><I>env_from</I> whitelist</A>
entries?
<DD>
DCC checksums are of the entire header line or envelope value.
An entry in the whitelist file for <I>jsmith@example.com</I>
will have no effect on mail with an envelope value of
<I>"J.Smith"&nbsp;jsmith@example.com</I>.
The file must contain <I>"J.Smith"&nbsp;jsmith@example.com</I>.
<P>
Another common cause for this problem is implied by the fact that
for an <I>env_from</I> whitelist entry
to have any effect, dccproc must be able to find the envelope value
in the message in a <I>Return-Path</I> header,
an old UNIX-style <I>From_</I> header, or an <B>-f</B> argument.
If your mail delivery agent does not add a <I>Return-Path</I> header
and you do not use
<A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-f">dccproc&nbsp;-f</A>,
then dccproc cannot know about
white or blacklist entries for envelope return addresses.
<P>
Note also that dccproc has no whitelist by default and
that <A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-w">dccproc&nbsp;-w</A>
must be used.


<P><DT><A NAME="delck">
What if I make a mistake with</A>
<A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-t">dccproc&nbsp;-t&nbsp;many</A>
and report legitimate mail as spam?
<DD>
It is possible to delete checksums from the distributed DCC
database with the <A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-delck-type-hex1-hex2-hex3-hex4">
cdcc&nbsp;delck</A>
operation.
However, it is not worth the trouble.
Unless the same (as far as the fuzzy checksums are concerned) message
is sent again, no one is likely to notice the mistake before the
report of the message's checksums expire from the DCC servers'
databases for lack of repetition.


<P><DT><A NAME="whitelist8">
Can the sendmail "spamfriend" mechanism tell</A>
<A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A> to not check mail sent to some addresses?
<DD>
Sendmail decisions to accept, reject, or discard mail are largely
independent of the decisions made by dccm.
The DCC equivalent is to add
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">env_to</A> entries to the
<A HREF="dccm.html#FILE-whiteclnt">dccm whitelist</A>.
See the sample <A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">@prefix@/whiteclnt</A> file in the
DCC source
<P>
However, if your sendmail.cf file sets the
<I>dcc_notspam</I> macro while processing the
envelope, then the message will by whitelisted.
This is related to the <I>dcc_isspam</I> macro
used by sendmail.cf modified by
<A HREF="misc/hackmc">@libexecdir@/hackmc&nbsp;-R</A>
to tell dccm to report blacklisted messages as spam to the DCC server.


<P><DT><A NAME="whitelist12">
How do I tell</A> <A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A> and sendmail
to not check mail for an entire domain?
<DD>
To whitelist all mail addressed to mailboxes in a local domain name,
first modify sendmail.cf with the
<A HREF="misc/hackmc">@libexecdir@/hackmc&nbsp;-O</A> script.
Then add the following line to the sendmail access_DB file and rebuild
the database with the sendmail tool, <I>makemap</I>:
<PRE>
	To:domain.com       DCC:OK
</PRE>
<P>
You can apply finer control by adding
a third argument to the FEATURE(dcc) macro in your sendmail.mc file
as described in
<A HREF="misc/dcc.m4">misc/dcc.m4</A>.
All mail for the domain can use a single "per-user"
<A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">whiteclnt</A> file,
often in the @prefix@/userdirs/esmtp/example.com, where @prefix@/userdirs
is the default value for <EM>DCCM_USERDIRS</EM> in the DCC configuration file
<A HREF="homedir/dcc_conf">@prefix@/dcc_conf</A>.
Making @prefix@/userdirs/esmtp a symbolic link to @prefix@/userdir/local
can be useful.
<P>
To whitelist all mail sent <I>from</I> a domain,
add a line like the following to the global
<A HREF="homedir/whiteclnt">@prefix@/whiteclnt</A> file
or a per-user whiteclnt file:
<PRE>
OK      substitute mail_host   example.com
</PRE>
<P>
See the <A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">DCC man page</A>.



<P><DT><A NAME="false-positives">
How can I avoid polluting databases of DCC servers with
checksums of my mail that is not spam?</A>
<DD>
Reports of checksums with
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">whitelist</A>
entries in your server's database are not flooded to its peers.
The checksums of messages whitelisted with entries in local
<A HREF="dccm.html">dccm</A> or <A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A>
whitelists are not reported to DCC servers.
It is good to add entries to DCC server and client
<A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">whitelists</A>
for localhost, your IP address blocks, and your domains if
you know that none of your users will ever send spam.
<P>
However, in the common mode in which the DCC is used, no
checksums of mail are pollution.
Checksums of genuinely private mail will have target counts of
1 or a small number, and so will not be flooded by your server to
other servers.
Strangers will not see your private mail and so will not be able
to ask any DCC server about the checksums of your private mail.
On the other hand, the DCC functions best by collecting reports
of the receipt of bulk mail as soon as possible.
That implies that it is generally desirable
to send reports of all mail to a DCC server.
The DCC flooding protocol does not send checksums with counts
below 10 <!--fix if BULK_THRESHOLD changes-->
to other servers.


<P><DT><A NAME="spamtrap">
Can DCC be fed with <Q lang="en-us">spam traps</Q>?</A>
<DD>
A spam trap is a mail address that should practically
never receive legitimate mail,
and that treats any mail that it does receive as spam.
A spam trap might be a common name such as
<Q lang="en-us">user1</Q> that has never been valid
and is discovered by unsolicited bulk email
advertisers by <Q lang="en-us">dictionary attacks</Q> or guessing.
It might instead be an address hidden in a web page
or a mailbox of an account that has been disabled for many months.
<P>
Any spam trap might receive legitimate mail.
For example, a spam trap that differs from an ordinary mailbox by a
single character might receive mail intended for the ordinary mailbox.
It might be best for a system to reject mail sent to such a trap so
that legitimate mail senders know that their messages have gone astray.
A mailbox that is a long string of arbitrary letters and digits is much
less likely to receive legitimate messages and so might best accept
all messages without complaint.
<P>
There are several ways to connect
<Q lang="en-us">spam trap</Q> mailboxes to DCC:
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc</A>
<DD>
For example,
<PRE>dccproc -R -tMANY -cCMN,MANY -o/dev/null</PRE>
will accept a message on STDIN,
look for the IP address of the sender among
<Q lang="en-us">Received:</Q> SMTP fields,
reports the message to the DCC server as spam and the IP address as the sender,
and exit with the default value of
<A HREF="dccproc.html#OPTION-x">dccproc&nbsp;-x</A>.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="dccifd/dccif-test/dccif-test.c">dccif-test</A>
<DD>
dccif-test was written to test the interface to the DCC interface daemon,
<A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd</A>.
When wired to a spam trap, it is more efficient than dccproc.
For example,
<PRE>dccif-test -cclnt-IP-addr -oSPAM -O/dev/null</PRE>
will do much the same as the dccproc example above.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists">whiteclnt file</A> option line
<DD>
The best way to build a spam trap is with a
per-user <A HREF="dccm.html#OPTION-w">whiteclnt file</A>
with an
<EM>option spam-trap-accept</EM> or <EM>option spam-trap-reject</EM>
line.
<P>
With sendmail, virtual user mapping can be used to send mail to invalid
mailboxes to a single mailbox whose corresponding DCC per-user
whiteclnt file contains an
<EM>option spam-trap-accept</EM> or <EM>option spam-trap-reject</EM>
line.
</DL>


<P><DT><A NAME="flood3">
How many flooding peers does my DCC server need?</A>
<DD>
A single flooding peer delivers all reports of checksums of bulk
mail seen by any DCC server.  Additional peers provided reports
sooner and so help the clients of a peer detect spews of spam sooner.
However, more peers will cause more reports to be duplicates.
<P>
A DCC server in a network of many servers should have at least three
flooding peers to ensure that the failure of a single server or network
link cannot partition the network.
Limiting the number the number of peers of any server to four or perhaps
a few more ensures that no single server is critical to the network.
To minimize the distances in the network, four peers
per server seem necessary.
<P>
An organization with more than one server can be viewed as a single
server by other organizations, with its servers flooding each other
and external peers spread among its servers.
This protects the network should the organization suffer large scale problems
while protecting the organization from single points of failure.


<P><DT><A NAME="flood1">
Do I need to tell the operators of other DCC servers
the password for controlling my server to turn on flooding?</A>
<DD>
No, you do not need to and generally should not tell other DCC server
operators the passwords for controlling your server with
the <A HREF="cdcc.html">cdcc</A> command.
Every Inter-server flood of checksums is authorized by lines in
each server's <A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-flod">@prefix@/flod</A> file
and authenticated by the password associated with the
<A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-flod">passwd-ID</A> in those lines.
The passwd-ID is a <A HREF="dcc.html#Client-and-Server-IDs">server-ID</A>
defined in the <A HREF="dccd.html#FILE-ids">@prefix@/ids</A> file
that should generally be used only to authenticate floods of checksums.


<P><DT><A NAME="flood2">
How can I figure out why flooding is not working?</A>
<DD>
Many DCC server problems can be diagnosed by turning
on one or more of the tracing modes in the server with the
<A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-trace">cdcc&nbsp;trace</A> operation
or by restarting the server with
<A HREF="dccd.html#OPTION-T">dccd&nbsp;-T</A>.
<P>
The <A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-flood-list">cdcc flood list</A>
operation displays the current flooding peers of a DCC server.
Counts of checksum reports sent and received to and from
a single peer can be displayed with
<A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-flood-stats">cdcc&nbsp;"flood stats ID"</A>
<P>
The positions in the local database of outgoing streams of checksums
are displayed by the start of <A HREF="dblist.html">dblist&nbsp;-Hv</A>.


<P><DT><A NAME="nagios">
How do I monitor my DCC clients and servers?  Is there a nagios plugin?</A>
<DD>
The DCC source includes a shell script
<A HREF="misc/dcc-nagios">@libexecdir@/dcc-nagios</A>
that can be used as
a <A HREF="http://www.nagios.org/">nagios</A> plugin.


<P><DT><A NAME="rtt">
Why didn't the RTT reported by the</A>
<A HREF="cdcc.html#OPERATION-info">cdcc&nbsp;info</A> operation
change when my network topology changed?
<DD>
The RTT or round trip time is an average value.
Changes in network topology, server load, and so forth are not
immediately reflected in the RTT to avoid switching DCC servers
too frequently.


<P><DT><A NAME="socks1">
When my clients are configured to use SOCKS, they do not
realize immediately when a server is down.</A>
<DD>
When configured to use SOCKS, DCC clients cannot "connect"
to a server and so do not receive ICMP errors and must wait for
timeouts to know the server is not answering.
