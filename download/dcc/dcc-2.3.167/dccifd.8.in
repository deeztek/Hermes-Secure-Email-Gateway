.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm
is a daemon intended to connect spam filters such as SpamAssasin
and mail transfer agents (MTAs) other than sendmail to DCC servers.
The MTA or filter
.Nm
which in turn reports related checksums to the nearest DCC server
and adds an
.Em X-DCC
SMTP header line to the message.
The MTA is told to reject the message if it is unsolicited bulk.
.Pp
.Nm Dccifd
is similar to the DCC sendmail milter interface,
.Xr dccm 8
and the DCC Procmail interface,
.Xr dccproc 8 .
.Nm Dccifd
is more efficient than
.Xr dccproc 8
but not restricted to use with sendmail like
.Xr dccm 8 .
All three send reports of checksums related to mail received by DCC clients
and queries about the total number of reports of particular checksums.
.Pp
MTA programs use a simple ASCII protocol a subset of SMTP to send
a mail message including its SMTP envelope to the daemon.
.Nm Dccifd
responds with an indication of whether the message is unsolicited bulk
and an optional copy of the message with an
.Em X-DCC
header added.
The ASCII protocol is described below and in the
.Pa include/dccif.h
file in the DCC source.
There is a sample C interface routine in the
.Pa dcclib/dccif.c
file in the DCC source and the
.Pa dcclib.a
library generated from the source.
A
.Em Perl
version of the interface routine is in
.Pa dccifd/dccif.pl .
Test or demonstration programs in the style of
.Xr dccproc 8
that use those interface routines are in
.Pa @prefix@/build/dcc/dccifd/dccif-test .
.Pp
A subset of ESMTP can be used instead of the ASCII protocol
to connect
.Nm
to postfix as a "Before-Queue Content Filter."
See the
.Fl o
flag.
.Pp
Since the checksums of messages that are whitelisted locally
by the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file are not reported to the DCC server,
.Nm
knows nothing about the total recipient counts for their checksums and
so cannot add
.Em X-DCC
header lines to such messages.
.Pp
Enable the daemon and put its parameters in the
.Pa @prefix@/dcc_conf
file and start the daemon with the
.Pa @libexecdir@/rcDCC
or
.Pa @libexecdir@/start-dccifd
scripts.
.Pp
The list of servers that
.Nm
contacts is in the memory mapped file
.Pa @prefix@/map
shared by local DCC clients.
The file is  maintained with
.Xr cdcc 8 .
.Ss OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl V
displays the version of
.Nm .
Two or more
.Fl V
options show the options with which it was built.
.It Fl d
enables debugging output from the DCC client software.
Additional
.Fl d
options increase the number of messages.
A single
.Fl d
logs aborted SMTP transactions including those from some "dictionary attacks."
.It Fl b
causes the daemon to not detach itself from the controlling tty
and put itself into the background.
.It Fl x
causes the daemon to try "extra hard" to contact a DCC server.
Since it is usually more important to deliver mail than to report its
checksums,
.Nm
normally does not delay too long while trying to contact a DCC server.
It will not try again for several seconds after a failure.
With
.Fl x ,
it will always try to contact the DCC server
and it will tell the MTA to answer the DATA command with a 4yz
temporary failure.
.It Fl A
adds to existing X-DCC headers in the message
instead of replacing existing headers
of the brand of the current server.
.It Fl N
neither adds, deletes, nor replaces existing X-DCC headers in the message.
Each mail message is logged, rejected, and otherwise handled the same.
.It Fl P
The SpamAsassin DCC.pm plugin should watch for "bulk" in X-DCC SMTP header
fields, but historically has looked for counts of "many".
However, there are situations when
.Nm
knows that a mail message is extremely bulky and probably spam.
For example, mail from a sender that is blacklisted in
.Pa whiteclnt
gets an X-DCC header that includes
.Em bulk .
To acommodate that bug in SpamAssassin, by default whenever
.Nm
generates an X-DCC header containing "bulk",
it also forces the
.Em Body
count to "many".
.Fl P
turns off that kludge and the
.Em Body
contains the count from the DCC server.
.It Fl Q
only queries the DCC server about the checksums of messages
instead of reporting.
This is useful when
.Nm
is used to filter mail that has already been reported to a DCC
server by another DCC client.
No single mail message should be reported to a DCC
server more than once per recipient,
because each report will increase the apparent "bulkness" of the message.
.Pp
It is better to use
.Em MXDCC
lines in the global
.Pa @prefix@/whiteclnt
file for your MX mail servers that use DCC than to use
.Fl Q
with
.Nm .
.Pp
Do not use
.Fl Q
except on mail that you know has been reported to a DCC server.
DCC depends on reports of all except known private mail and
works only because almost no DCC installations use
.Fl Q .
.It Fl G Ar on | off | noIP | IPmask/xx
controls
.Em greylisting .
At least one working greylist server must be listed in the
.Pa @prefix@/map
file.
If more than one is named,
they must "flood" or change checksums and they must use the
same
.Fl G
parameters.
See
.Xr dccd 8 .
Usually all dccm or dccifd DCC client processes use the same
.Fl G
parameters.
.Pp
.Ar IPmask/xx
and
.Ar noIP
remove part or all of the IP address from the greylist triple.
.It Fl h Ar homedir
overrides the default DCC home directory,
.Pa @prefix@ .
.It Fl I Ar user
specifies the UID and GID of the process.
.It Fl p Ar /sock/name | lhost,lport,rhost
overrides the default address at which programs contact
.Nm dccifd .
The default is a UNIX domain socket named dccifd in the DCC home directory.
.Pp
The second form specifies a local host name or IP address,
a local TCP port number,
and the host name or IP addresses of computers that can use
.Nm dccifd .
127.0.0.1 is a common choices for
.Ar lhost .
The string
.Ar *
for
.Ar lhost
specifies IN_ADDRANY or all local IP addresses.
127.0.0.1 is a common choice for
.Ar rhost ,
but it can be a
.Em xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/mm
CIDR block or a
.Em xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx-yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy
range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
.It Fl o Ar /sock | host,port
enables SMTP proxy mode instead of the ASCII protocol
and specifies the output connection when
.Nm
acts as an SMTP proxy.
It is the address of the SMTP server
for which
.Nm
acts as SMTP client.
When
.Ar /sock
is
.Pa /dev/null ,
.Nm
acts as if there were downstream SMTP server that always answers "250\ ok".
The string
.Ar @
specifies the same IP address as the incoming TCP connection.
.Pp
The input to
.Nm
in SMTP proxy mode is specified with
.Fl p .
For example,
.Fl p Ar 127.0.0.1,10025,127.0.0.1/32 Fl o Ar 127.0.0.1,10026
could be used to connect
.Nm
with Postfix as described in the documentation in version 2.2.1 Postfix
documentation.
.Pp
See below concerning the subset of ESMTP used in this mode.
.It Fl m Ar map
specifies a name or path of the memory mapped parameter file instead
of the default
.Pa @prefix@/map .
It should be created with the
.Xr cdcc 8
command.
.It Fl w Ar whiteclnt
specifies an optional file containing filtering parameters
as well as SMTP client IP addresses,
SMTP envelope values, and header values
of mail that is spam or is not spam and does not need a
.Em X-DCC
header,
and whose checksums should not be reported to the DCC server.
.Pp
If the pathname
.Ar whiteclnt
is not absolute, it is relative to the DCC home directory.
.Pp
The format of the
.Nm
whiteclnt file is the same as the
.Pa @prefix@/whitelist
files used by
.Xr dbclean 8
and the
.Pa whiteclnt
file used by
.Xr dccproc 8 .
See
.Xr dcc 8
for a description of DCC white and blacklists.
Because the contents of the
.Ar whiteclnt
file are used frequently, a companion file is automatically
created and maintained.
It has the same pathname but with an added suffix of
.Ar .dccw
and contains a memory mapped hash table of the main file.
.Pp
A whitelist entry ("OK") or two or more semi-whitelistings ("OK2")
for one of the message's checksums prevents all of
the message's checksums from being reported to the DCC server
and the addition of a
.Em X-DCC
header line by
.Nm .
A whitelist entry for a checksum
also prevents rejecting or discarding the message based on DCC recipient
counts as specified by
.Fl a
and
.Fl t .
Otherwise, one or more checksums with blacklisting entries ("MANY") cause
all of the message's
checksums to be reported to the server with an addressee count of "MANY".
.Pp
If the message has a single recipient, an
.Ar env_To
.Ar whiteclnt
entry of "OK" for the checksum of its recipient address acts like any other
.Ar whiteclnt
entry of "OK."
When the SMTP message has more than one recipient,
the effects can be complicated.
When a message has several recipients with some but not all listed in the
.Ar whiteclnt
file,
.Nm
tries comply with the wishes of the users who want filtering as
well as those who don't by silently not delivering the message to 
those who want filtering (i.e. are not whitelisted) and delivering
the message to users who don't want filtering.
.It Fl U Ar userdirs
enables per-user
.Pa whiteclnt
files and log directories.
Each target of a message can have a directory of log files named
.Ar userdirs/addr/log
where
.Ar addr
is the local user or mailbox name computed by the MTA.
The name of each user's log directory must be
.Ar log .
If it is not absolute,
.Ar userdirs
is relative to the DCC home directory.
The directory containing the log files must be named
.Ar log
and it must be writable by the
.Nm
process.
Each log directory must exist or logging for the corresponding
is silently disabled.
The files created in the log directory are owned by the UID of the
.Nm
process,
but they have
.Em group
and
.Em other
read and write permissions copied from the corresponding
.Ar log
directory.
To ensure the privacy of mail,
it may be good to make the directories readable only by
.Em owner
and
.Em group ,
and to use a
.Xr cron
script that changes the owner of each file to match the grandparent
.Ar addr
directory.
.Pp
There can also be a per-user whitelist file named
.Ar userdirs/addr/whiteclnt
for each addressee
.Ar addr.
Any checksum that is not white- or blacklisted by an individual
addressee's per-user
.Pa whiteclnt
file  is checked in the main
.Pa @prefix@/whiteclnt
file.
A missing per-addressee
.Ar whiteclnt
file is the same as an empty file.
Relative paths for files included in per-addressee files
are resolved in the DCC home directory.
The
.Ar whiteclnt
files and the
.Ar addr
directories containing them must be writable by the
.Nm
process.
.Pp
.Ar Option
lines in per-user whiteclnt files can be used to modify many aspects of
.Nm
filtering,
as described in the main
.Xr dcc
man page.
For example, an
.Ar option dcc-off
line turns off DCC filtering for individual mailboxes.
.It Fl a Ar IGNORE | REJECT | DISCARD
specifies the action taken when
.Nm
is in proxy mode with
.Fl o
and
DCC server counts or
.Fl t
thresholds say that a message is unsolicited and bulk.
.Ar IGNORE
causes the message to be unaffected except for adding the
.Em X-DCC
header line to the message.
This turns off all filtering except greylisting.
.Pp
Spam can also be
.Ar REJECT Ns ed
or when in proxy mode with
.Fl o
accepted and silently
.Ar DISCARD Ns ed
without being delivered to local mailboxes.
The default is
.Ar REJECT .
.Pp
Mail forwarded via IP addresses marked
.Em MX
or
.Em MXDCC
in the main
.Pa @prefix@/whiteclnt
file is treated
as if
.Fl a Ar DISCARD
were specified.
This prevents "bouncing" spam.
.Pp
The effects of the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
are not affected by
.Fl a .
.It Fl t Xo
.Sm off
.Ar type,
.Op Ar log-thold,
.Ar rej-thold
.Sm on
.Xc
sets logging and "spam" thresholds for checksum
.Ar type .
The checksum types are
.Ar IP ,
.Ar env_From ,
.Ar From ,
.Ar Message-ID ,
.Ar substitute ,
.Ar Received ,
.Ar Body ,
.Ar Fuz1 ,
.Ar Fuz2 ,
.Ar rep-total ,
and
.Ar rep .
The first six,
.Ar IP
through
.Ar substitute ,
have no effect except when a local DCC server configured with
.Fl K
is used.
The
.Ar substitute
thresholds apply to the first substitute heading encountered in the mail
message.
The string
.Ar ALL
sets thresholds for all types, but is unlikely to be useful except for
setting logging thresholds.
The string
.Ar CMN
specifies the commonly used checksums
.Ar Body ,
.Ar Fuz1 ,
and
.Ar Fuz2 .
.Ar Rej-thold
and
.Ar log-thold
must be numbers, the string
.Ar NEVER ,
or the string
.Ar MANY
indicating millions of targets.
Counts from the DCC server as large as the threshold for any single type
are taken as sufficient evidence
that the message should be logged or rejected.
.Pp
.Ar Log-thold
is the threshold at which messages are logged.
It can be handy to log messages at a lower threshold to find
solicited bulk mail sources such as mailing lists.
If no logging threshold is set,
only rejected mail and messages with complicated combinations of white
and blacklisting are logged.
Messages that reach at least one of their rejection thresholds are
logged regardless of logging thresholds.
.Pp
.Ar Rej-thold
is the threshold at which messages are considered "bulk,"
and so should be rejected or discarded if not whitelisted.
.Pp
DCC Reputation thresholds in the commercial version
of DCC are controlled by thresholds on checksum types
.Ar rep
and
.Ar rep-total .
The DCC Reputations of IP addresses that the DCC database says have sent
more than
.Ar rep-total,log-thold
are computed and messages from those addresses are logged.
Messages from IP addresses with DCC Reputations of at least the
.Ar rep,rej-thold
rejection threshold can be rejected.
The DCC Reputation of an IP address is the percentage of its messages
known to have been sent to at least 10 recipients.
The defaults are equivalent to
.Ar rep,never
and
.Ar rep-total,never,20 .
.Pp
Bulk DCC Reputations do not reject mail unless enabled by an
.Ar option\ DCC-rep-on
line a
.Pa whiteclnt
file.
.Pp
The checksums of locally whitelisted messages are not checked with
the DCC server and so only the number of targets of the current copy of
a whitelisted message are compared against the thresholds.
.Pp
The default is
.Ar ALL,NEVER ,
so that nothing is discarded, rejected, or logged.
A common choice is
.Ar CMN,25,50
to reject or discard
mail with common bodies except as overridden by
the whitelist of the DCC server, the sendmail
.Em ${dcc_isspam}
and
.Em ${dcc_notspam}
macros, and
.Fl g ,
and
.Fl w .
.It Fl g Xo
.Sm off
.Op Ar not-
.Ar type
.Sm on
.Xc
indicates that whitelisted,
.Ar OK
or
.Ar OK2 ,
counts from the DCC server for a type of checksum are to be believed.
They should be ignored if prefixed with
.Ar not- .
.Ar Type
is one of the same set of strings as for
.Fl t .
Only
.Ar IP ,
.Ar env_From ,
and
.Ar From
are likely choices.
By default all three are honored,
and hence the need for
.Ar not- .
.It Fl S Ar hdr
adds to the list of substitute or locally chosen headers that
are checked with the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file and sent to the DCC server.
The checksum of the last header of type
.Ar hdr
found in the message is checked.
.Ar Hdr
can be
.Em HELO
to specify the SMTP envelope HELO value.
.Ar Hdr
can also be
.Em mail_host
to specify the host name from
the Mail_from value in the SMTP envelope.
As many as 8 different substitute headers can be specified, but only
the checksum of the first will be sent to the DCC server.
.It Fl l Ar logdir
specifies a directory in which files containing copies of messages processed by
.Nm
are kept.
They can be copied to per-user directories specified with
.Fl U .
Information about other recipients of a message is deleted from
the per-user copies.
.Pp
If
.Ar logdir
is in the form
.Ar D?dir ,
log files are put into subdirectories of
.Ar dir
the form
.Ar dir/JJJ
where
.Ar JJJ
is the current julian day.
.Ar H?dir
puts logs files into subdirectories of the form
.Ar dir/JJJ/HH
where
.Ar HH
is the current hour.
.Ar M?dir
puts log files into subdirectories of the form
.Ar dir/JJJ/HH/MM
where
.Ar MM
is the current minute.
.Pp
The directory is relative to the DCC home directory if it is not absolute
.Pp
.Ar Option log-subdirectory-{day,hour,minute}
lines in
.Pa whiteclnt
files described in
.Xr dcc 8
are an equivalent mechanism for per-user log directories.
Also see the FILES section below concerning the contents of log files.
.It Fl R Ar rundir
specifies the "run" directory where the file
containing the daemon's process ID is stored.
The default value is
.Pa @dcc_rundir@ .
.It Fl T Ar tmpdir
changes the default directory for temporary files from the default.
The default is the directory specified with
.Fl l
or the system default if
.Fl l
is not used.
The system default is often
.Pa /tmp .
.It Fl D Ar local-domain
specifies a host or domain name by which the system is known.
There can be several
.Fl D
settings.
.Pp
To find the per-user log directory and whitelist for each mail recipient,
.Nm
must know each recipient's user name.
The ASCII protocol used between
.nm
and the MTA includes an optional user name with each
SMTP recipient address.
When the user name is absent when the ASCII protocol is used or when
the subset of ESMTP enabled with
.Fl o
is used,
and when the SMTP recipient address includes an
.Em at sign
(@)
each mail address is checked against the
list of
.Ar local-domain Ns s.
The part of the recipient address remaining after longest matching
.Ar local-domain
(if any) is taken as the user name.
The match is anchored at the right or the end of the recipient address.
It must start at a period (.) or
.Em at sign
(@) in the domain name part of the address.
.Pp
If
.Ar local-domain
starts with an asterisk (*) indicating a wildcard,
preceding sub-domain names are discarded to compute the user name.
Otherwise, the computed user name will include any unmatched sub-domain
names.
.Pp
The default value of
.Ar local-domain
when there are no
.Fl D
settings is the host name of the system.
.It Fl r Ar rejection-msg
specifies the rejection message
in
.Fl o
proxy mode
for unsolicited bulk mail or for mail temporarily blocked by
.Em greylisting
when
.Fl G
is specified.
The first
.Fl r Ar rejection-msg
replaces the default bulk mail rejection message,
.Bk -words
"5.7.1 550 mail %ID from %CIP rejected by DCC".
.Ek
The second replaces
.Bk -words
"4.2.1 452 mail %ID from %CIP temporary greylist embargoed".
.Ek
The third
.Fl r Ar rejection-msg
replaces the default SMTP rejection message
.Bk -words
"5.7.1 550 %ID bulk mail reputation; see https://commercial-dcc.rhyolite.com/cgi-bin/reps.cgi?tgt=%CIP"
.Ek
for mail with bulk DCC Reputations.
If
.Ar rejection-msg
is the zero-length string,
the
.Fl r
setting is counted but the corresponding default message is not changed.
.Pp
.Ar Rejection-msg
can contain specific information about the mail message.
The following strings starting with % are replaced with the corresponding
values:
.Bl -tag -width "%BRESULT" -offset 4n -compact
.It %ID
message ID such as the unique part of log file name or sendmail queue ID
.It %CIP
SMTP client IP address
.It %BTYPE
type of DNS blacklist hit, such as "SMTP client", "mail_host", or "URL NS"
.It %BTGT
IP address or name declared bad by DNS blacklist
.It %BPROBE
domain name found in DNS blacklist such as 4.3.2.10.example.com
.It %BRESULT
value of the %BPROBE domain name found in DNS blacklist
.El
.Pp
A common alternate for the bulk mail rejection message is
.Bk -words
"4.7.1 451 Access denied by DCC"
.Ek
to tell the sending mail system to continue trying.
Use a 4yz response with caution, because it is likely to delay for days
a delivery failure message for false positives.
If the rejection message
does not start with an RFC 1893 status code and RFC 2821 reply code,
5.7.1 and 550 or 4.2.1 and 452 are used.
.Pp
See also
.Fl B Ar set:rej-msg
to set the status message for mail rejected by DNS blacklists.
.It Fl j Ar maxjobs
limits the number of simultaneous requests that will be processed.
The default value is the maximum number that seems to be possible given system
limits on open files, select() bit masks, and so forth.
Start
.Nm
with
.Fl d
and see the starting message in the system log to see the limit.
.It Fl B Ar dnsbl-option
enables DNS white- and blacklist checks of the SMTP client IP address,
SMTP envelope Mail_From sender domain name, and of host names in
URLs in the message body.
Body URL blacklisting has too many false positives to use on
abuse mailboxes.
It is less effective than greylisting with
.Xr dccm 8
or
.Xr dccifd 8
but can be useful in situations where
greylisting cannot be used.
It can be combined with greylisting.

.Ar Domain
is a DNS blacklist domain such as
.Em example.com
that will be searched.
The strings
.Ar any ,
.Ar IPaddr ,
.Ar IPaddr/xx ,
or
.Ar IPaddrLO-IPaddrHI ,
specifies which IP addresses found in the DNS blacklist
after applying the optional IP address mask
.Ar IPmask
say that mail messages should be rejected or accepted with
.Fl B Ar set:white .
"127.0.0.2" is assumed if no address(es) are specified.
IPv6 addresses can be specified with the usual colon (:) notation.
Host names can be used instead of numeric addresses.
The type of DNS blacklist
is specified by
.Ar bltype
as
.Ar name ,
.Ar all-names ,
.Ar IPv4 ,
or
.Ar IPv6 .
Given an envelope sender domain name or a domain name in a URL of
spam.domain.org
and a blacklist of type
.Ar name ,
spam.domain.org.example.com will be looked up.
The names
spam.domain.org.example.com,
domain.org.example.com, and
org.example.com
will be looked up in blacklists of type
.Ar all-names .
Use
.Ar name
with DNS blacklists that use wildcards for speed
but
.Ar all-names
for other DNS name blacklists.
Blacklist types of
.Ar IPv4
and
.Ar IPv6
require that the domain name in a URL sender address
be resolved into an IPv4 or IPv6
address.
The resolved address from the mail message
is then written as a reversed string of decimal
octets to check the DNS blacklist, as in
.Em 2.0.0.127.example.com .
.Pp
A
.Ar domain
of "."
and type of
.Ar name
can be used to blacklist domain names with specified addresses.
This can be useful to detect URLs with domain names listed in
a Response Policy Zone (RPZ).
For example, the following can be used to reject mail
containing URLs listed by a response policy zone that maps
evil domain names to 224.0.0.0 with an informative status
message:
.Bd -literal
  '-Bset:rej-msg=5.7.1 550 %ID %BTYPE \\
	https://example.com/query/dbl?domain=%BTGT'
  -B.,224.0.0.0,name
.Ed
.Pp
More than one blacklist can be specified and blacklists can be grouped with
.Fl B Ar set:group=X .
All searching within a group of blacklists
is stopped at the first positive result.
.Pp
Unlike
.Xr dccproc 8 ,
positive results are ignored by 
.Nm
after being logged unless an

.Fl B Ar set:client
restores the default for the following blacklists.
.It Fl B Ar set:no-mail_host
implies that SMTP envelope Mail_From sender domain names should
not be checked in the following blacklists.
.Fl B Ar set:mail_host
restores the default.
.It Fl B Ar set:no-URL
says that URLs in the message body should not be checked in the

says MX servers of sender Mail_From domain names and host names in URLs
should not be checked in the following blacklists.
.br
.Fl B Ar set:MX
restores the default.
.It Fl B Ar set:no-NS
says DNS servers of sender Mail_From domain names and host names in URLs
should not be checked in the following blacklists.
.Fl B Ar set:NS
restores the default.
.It Fl B Ar set:white
says the DNS list is a whitelist of names or IP addresses.

adds following DNS blacklists specified with
.Bk
.Fl B Xo

to group 1, 2, 3, or 4.
.It Fl B Ar set:debug=X
sets the DNS blacklist logging level
.It Fl B Ar set:msg-secs=S
limits
.Nm
to
.Ar S
seconds total for checking all DNS blacklists.
The default is 25.
.It Fl B Ar set:URL-secs=S
limits
.Nm
to at most
.Ar S
seconds resolving and checking any single URL or IP address.
The default is 11.
Some spam contains dozens of URLs and
some "spamvertised" URLs contain host names that need minutes to
resolve.
Busy mail systems cannot afford to spend minutes checking each incoming
mail message.
.It Fl B Ar set:rej-msg="rejection message"
sets the SMTP rejection message for the following blacklists.
.Ar Rejection-msg
must be in the same format as for
.Fl r .
If
.Ar rejection message
is null, the default is restored.
The default DNS blacklist rejection message is the first message set
with
.Fl r .
.It Fl B Ar set:max_helpers=X
sets maximum number of helper processes to
.Ar X .
In order to use typical single-threaded DNS resolver libraries,
.Nm
uses fleets of helper processes.
It is rarely a good idea to change the default,
which is the same as the maximum number of simultaneous jobs set with
.Fl j .
.It Fl B Ar set:progpath=@libexecdir@/dns-helper
changes the path to the helper program.
.El
.It Fl L Ar ltype,facility.level
specifies how messages should be logged.
.Ar Ltype
must be
.Ar error ,
.Ar info ,
or
.Ar off
to indicate which of the two types of messages are being controlled or
to turn off all
.Xr syslog 3
messages from
.Nm .
.Ar Level
must be a

.El
.Pp
.Nm
normally sends counts of mail rejected and so forth to the system log at
midnight.
The SIGUSR1 signal sends an immediate report to the system log.
The reports will be repeated every 24 hours at the same minute as the signal
instead of at midnight.
.Ss Protocol
Unless SMTP proxy mode is enabled with
.Fl o ,
.Nm Dccifd
uses a simple ASCII protocol to receive mail messages to be checked and
to return results.
For each message, the MTA must open a connection to the interface daemon,
send options, envelope recipients, and the message, receive the results,
and close the connection.
.Pp
Instead of the ASCII protocol, a subset of ESMTP is enabled by
.Fl o .
Only the familiar HELO, EHLO, Mail, Rcpt, DATA, RSET, and QUIT
commands and the Postfix extensions XFORWARD and XCLIENT are honored.
Since SMTP has no provisions for user names,
the protocol enabled by
.Fl o
depends on a list of local domain names specified with
.Fl D
to find per-user log directories and whitelist files.
If neither XFORWARD nor XCLIENT are used,
.Nm
uses the IP address of the MTA and the value of the HELO command.
.Pp
In the ASCII protocol, each of the following lines are sent in order to
.Nm .
Each ends with a newline ('\\n') character.
.Bl -tag -offset 2n -width "recipients" -compact
.It options
zero or more blank-separated strings among:
.Bl -tag -offset 2n -width grey-query -compact
.It Ar spam
the message is already known to be spam
.It Ar body
return all of the headers with the added
.Em X-DCC
header line and the body
.It Ar header
return the
.Em X-DCC
header
.It Ar cksums
return
.Em X-DCC
header and the checksums for the message.
.It Ar query
ask the DCC server about the message without reporting it, as if
.Nm
were running with
.Fl Q .
.It Ar grey-off
disable greylisting for this message.
.It Ar grey-query
only query the greylist server for this message.
.Fl G Ar on
must be in use.
.It Ar no-reject
has the same effect as running
.Nm
with
.Bk -words
.Fl a Ar IGNORE .
.Ek
It suppresses the overall, one character line 'R' result.
This can be useful when using
.Nm
only for greylisting.
.It Ar log
ensure that this message is logged as if
.Nm
were running with
.Fl t all,0,
.It Ar rcvd-next
causes
.Nm
to skip a Received: header looking for the client IP address and HELO value.
Each additional
.Ar rcvd-next
option increases the number of Received: headers skipped.
.Em MX
or
.Em MXDCC
in the global
.Bk -words
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
.Ek
file usually work better.
.El
.It client
IP address of the SMTP client in a "dotted" or "coloned" ASCII string
and reverse-DNS host name.
If the host name is present,
it must follow a carriage return character ('\\r') after the IP address.
The client IP address must be present and non-null if the host name is present.
The string "0.0.0.0\\n" is understood the same as the null string,
meaning that both the IP address and host name are absent.
If the client IP address is absent, then the IP address and host name
are taken from the first non-local Received header if it has the standard
"name (name [IP address])..." format.
Non-standard Received headers commonly added by qmail as well as
Received headers specifying IP addresses marked
.Em MX
or
.Em MXDCC
in the global
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file are skipped.
.It HELO
SMTP HELO value or nothing, followed by a newline ('\\n') character.
If the HELO value is null and the IP address of the SMTP client are not
supplied, they will be
taken from the same Received: header that supplies the IP address.
.It sender
or SMTP
.Em Mail From
command value for the env_from checksum.
If the sender is null,
the contents of the first Return-Path: or UNIX style From_ header
is used.
.It recipients
or SMTP
.Em Rcpt To
recipient mailboxes followed by corresponding local user names,
one (mailbox,user) pair to a line.
Each optional local user name is separated from the
corresponding mailbox recipient address by a carriage return ('\\r').
A local user name can be null if it is not known, but each recipient
mailbox must be non-null.
If there are no lines of (mailbox,user) pairs and if the
.Ar spam
option is not included, then the
.Ar query
is assumed.
Mailboxes without user names will lack per-user log files
and cannot invoke a per-user
.Pa whiteclnt
file.
.El
.Pp
The last recipient-user name pair is followed by an empty line
and the headers and body of the message.
The end of the body of the mail message is signaled by the MTA
half-closing the connection.
See
.Xr shutdown 2 .
.Pp
.Nm Dccifd
responds with three things.
First is a one character line of the overall result advising the MTA:
.Bl -tag -offset 2n -width 3n -compact
.It A
accept the message for all recipients and answer the SMTP DATA command
with a 2yz result.
.It G
answer with a 4yz result to embargo the message for greylisting.
.It R
reject the message and answer the DATA command with a 5yz result.
.It S
accept the message for some recipients
and so answer the DATA command with a 2yz result.
.It T
temporary failure by the DCC system and so answer with a 4yz result.
.El
.Pp
Second is a line of characters indicating the disposition of the
message for each corresponding recipient:
.Bl -tag -offset 2n -width 3n -compact
.It A
deliver the message
.It G
discard the message during a greylist embargo
.It R
discard the message as spam
.El
The SMTP protocol allows only a single
result for the DATA command for all recipients that were not rejected
before body of the message was offered with the DATA command.
To accept the message for some recipients and reject it for others,
the MTA must tell the SMTP client it is accepting the message for all
recipients and then discard it for those that would reject it.
.Pp
Finally, if the
.Em body
or
.Em header
strings are in the first line of
.Em options
sent by the MTA to the daemon,
then the
.Em X-DCC
header line
or the entire body with the
.Em X-DCC
header line follows.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width dccifd.pid -compact
.It Pa @prefix@
is the DCC home directory in which other files are found.
.It Pa @libexecdir@/start-dccifd
or
.It Pa @libexecdir@/rcDCC
are scripts used to start the daemon.
.It Pa dcc_conf
contains parameters used by the scripts to start DCC daemons and cron jobs.
.It Pa logdir
is an optional directory specified with
.Fl l
and containing marked mail.
Each file in the directory contains one message, at least one of whose
checksums reached its
.Fl t
thresholds or that is interesting for some other reason.
Each file starts with lines containing the date when the message
was received, the IP address of the SMTP client, and SMTP envelope
values.
Those lines are followed by the body of the SMTP message including its header
as it was received.
Only approximately the first 32 KBytes of the body are recorded
unless modified by
.Em ./configure --with-max-log-size=xx
The checksums for the message follow the body.
They are followed by lines indicate that
one of the checksums is white- or blacklisted by the
.Fl w Ar whiteclnt
file.
Each log file ends with the
.Em X-DCC
header line added to the message and the disposition of
the message.
.It Pa map
is the memory mapped file of information concerning DCC servers
in the DCC home directory.
.It Pa whiteclnt
contains the client whitelist in
the format described in
.Xr dcc 8 .
.It Pa whiteclnt.dccw
is a memory mapped hash table of the
.Pa @prefix@/whiteclnt
file.
.It Pa dccifd.pid
in the
.Fl R Ar rundir
directory contains daemon's process ID.
.El

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
uses
.Fl t
where
.Xr dccproc 8
uses
.Fl c .
.Pp
By default
.Nm
look for its UNIX domain socket in the DCC home directory,
but
.Xr dccm 8
looks in its
.Fl R Ar rundir .
.Pp
Systems without
.Xr setrlimit 2
and
.Xr getrlimit 2
RLIMIT_NOFILE
can have problems with the default limit on the number of simultaneous
jobs, the value of
.Fl j .
Every job requires four open files.
These problems are usually seen with errors messages that say something like
.Dl dccifd[24448]: DCC: accept(): Result too large
A fix is to use a smaller value for
.Fl j
or to allow
.Nm
to open more files.
