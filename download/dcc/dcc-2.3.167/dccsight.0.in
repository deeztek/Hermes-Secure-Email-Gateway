DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDccccssiigghhtt reads one or more lines containing DCC checksums, reports them
     to a DCC server, and writes a X-DCC header line.  It can be used to
     report checksums obtained from dccproc(8) using --CC.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following options are available:

     --VV   displays the version of the DCC raw checksum interface.  Two or more
          --VV options show the options with which it was built.

     --dd   enables debugging output from the DCC client software.  Additional
          --dd options increase the number of messages.

     --PP   The SpamAsassin DCC.pm plugin should watch for "bulk" in X-DCC SMTP
          header fields, but historically has looked for counts of "many".
          However, there are situations when ddccccssiigghhtt knows that a mail mes-
          sage is extremely bulky and probably spam.  For example, mail from a
          sender that is blacklisted in _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t gets an X-DCC header that
          includes _b_u_l_k.  To acommodate that bug in SpamAssassin, by default
          whenever ddccccssiigghhtt generates an X-DCC header containing "bulk", it
          also forces the _B_o_d_y count to "many".  --PP turns off that kludge and
          the _B_o_d_y contains the count from the DCC server.

     --QQ   only queries the DCC server about the checksums of messages instead
          of reporting.  This is useful when ddccccssiigghhtt is used to filter mail
          that has already been reported to a DCC server by another DCC
          client.  No single mail message should be reported to a DCC server
          more than once per recipient, because each report will increase the
          apparent "bulkness" of the message.

          It is better to use _M_X_D_C_C lines in the global _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c_/_w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t
          file for your MX mail servers that use DCC than to use --QQ with
          ddccccssiigghhtt.

          Do not use --QQ except on mail that you know has been reported to a
          DCC server.  DCC depends on reports of all except known private mail
          and works only because almost no DCC installations use --QQ.

     --CC   outputs the checksums for the message as well as the X-DCC header.

     --hh _h_o_m_e_d_i_r
          overrides the default DCC home directory, _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c.

     --mm _m_a_p
          specifies a name or path of the memory mapped parameter file instead
          of the default _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c_/_m_a_p in the DCC home directory.  It should be
          created with the cdcc(8) command.

     --ww _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t
          specifies an optional file containing SMTP client IP addresses and
          SMTP headers of mail that do not need X-DCC headers and whose check-
          sums should not be reported to the DCC server.  It can also contain
          checksums of spam.  If the pathname is not absolute, it is relative
          to the DCC home directory.  Thus, individual users with private
          whitelists usually specify them with absolute paths.  It is useful
          to _i_n_c_l_u_d_e a common or system-wide whitelist in private lists.

          The format of the ddccccssiigghhtt whiteclnt file is the same as the
          _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c_/_w_h_i_t_e_l_i_s_t file required by dbclean(8) and dccsight(8).
          Because this list is used frequently, a companion file is used.  It
          has the same pathname but with an added suffix of _._d_c_c_w.  After
          being created empty, it will contain an automatic memory mapped hash
          table of the main file.

     --tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_s
          specifies the number of addressees of the message if other than 1.
          The string _m_a_n_y instead of a number asserts that there were too many
          addressees and that the message is unsolicited bulk email.

     --ii _i_n_f_i_l_e
          specifies an input file instead of standard input.  If not absolute,
          the pathname is interpreted relative to the directory in which
          ddccccssiigghhtt was started.

     --LL _l_t_y_p_e_,_f_a_c_i_l_i_t_y_._l_e_v_e_l
          specifies how messages should be logged.  _L_t_y_p_e must be _e_r_r_o_r, _i_n_f_o,
          or _o_f_f to indicate which of the two types of messages are being con-
          trolled or to turn off all syslog(3) messages from ddccccssiigghhtt.  _L_e_v_e_l
          must be a syslog(3) level among _E_M_E_R_G, _A_L_E_R_T, _C_R_I_T, _E_R_R, _W_A_R_N_I_N_G,
          _N_O_T_I_C_E, _I_N_F_O, and _D_E_B_U_G.  _F_a_c_i_l_i_t_y must be among _A_U_T_H, _A_U_T_H_P_R_I_V,
          _C_R_O_N, _D_A_E_M_O_N, _F_T_P, _K_E_R_N, _L_P_R, _M_A_I_L, _N_E_W_S, _U_S_E_R, _U_U_C_P, and _L_O_C_A_L_0
          through _L_O_C_A_L_7.  The default is equivalent to
                --LL _i_n_f_o_,_M_A_I_L_._N_O_T_I_C_E --LL _e_r_r_o_r_,_M_A_I_L_._E_R_R

     ddccccssiigghhtt exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
