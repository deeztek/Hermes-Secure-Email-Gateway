## About

Hermes Secure Email Gateway is a Free Open Source Ubuntu 18.04 Server based Email Gateway that provides Spam, Virus and Malware protection, full in-transit and at-rest email encryption as well as email archiving.

## Installation

Hermes SEG can be easily installed on your existing Ubuntu 18.04 server machine by utilizing the **ubuntu_hermes_1804_install.sh** script. The script requires that you have a fully updated Ubuntu 18.04 server installation and that you have a `/mnt/data` directory for database and email archive storage.

**Required Information**

The script will prompt you for the following information before it starts installation. Ensure you have that information available before you begin:

* MySQL(MariaDB) root user password you wish to use
* MySQL(MariaDB) username you wish to use with the hermes database (Example: hermes)
* MySQL(MariaDB) password you wish to use with the hermes database user
* MySQL(MariaDB) username you wish to use with the Syslog database (Example: rsyslog)
* MySQL(MariaDB) password you wish to use with the Syslog database user
* MySQL(MariaDB) username you wish to use with the cipermail database (Example: ciphermail)
* MySQL(MariaDB) password you wish to use with the ciphermail database user
* MySQL(MariaDB) username you wish to use with the opendmarc database (Example: opendmarc)
* MySQL(MariaDB) password you wish to use with the opendmarc database user
* Lucee Server and Web Administrator password you wish to use
* System Mailname (Example: smtp.domain.tld)


The **Configure /mnt/data partition** instructions below assume you have a 250 GB secondary drive which you will partition, format and mount as `/mnt/data`.

Technically, a secondary drive for the `/mnt/data` directory is not a requirement but it's highly recommended for performance reasons. If you don't wish to use a secondary drive for the `/mnt/data` directory, simply create a `/mnt/data` directory in your system and skip to the **Quick script install and run instructions** section.

**Configure /mnt/data partition**

`sudo mkdir /mnt/data`

`sudo fdisk -l `

Look for the device ID of the 250 GB drive you created earlier, it's usually `/dev/sdb`. Ensure you select the correct device ID before running the commands below.

**Create partition**

`sudo fdisk /dev/sdb`

* Hit "n" to add new partition
* Hit "p" for primary partition
* Hit "Enter" for partition 1
* Hit "Enter" for default: first sector
* Hit "Enter" for default: last sector
* Hit "w" to write changes to disk and exit

**Format Partition**

`sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1`

**Mount Partition to /mnt/data**

`sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data`

**Get disk UUID**

`ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid`

**Edit /etc/fstab**

`sudo vi /etc/fstab`

**Add the following in /etc/fstab where DEVICE_ID is the UUID from the command above**

`UUID=DEVICE_ID /mnt/data               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1`

**Verify drive is mounted**

`sudo df -h`

**Should yield output similar to below:**

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            1.9G     0  1.9G   0% /dev
tmpfs           395M  1.1M  394M   1% /run
/dev/sda2        79G  5.5G   69G   8% /
tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/loop0       87M   87M     0 100% /snap/core/4917
/dev/loop1       90M   90M     0 100% /snap/core/8039
tmpfs           395M     0  395M   0% /run/user/1000
/dev/sdb1       246G   61M  233G   1% /mnt/data
```

Reboot and ensure `/mnt/data` gets mounted automatically.

**Quick script install and run instructions**

Clone the Hermes SEG repository:

`sudo git clone https://github.com/deeztek/Hermes-Secure-Email-Gateway.git`

This will clone the repository and create a Hermes-Secure-Email-Gateway directory in the directory you ran the git clone command from.

Change to the Hermes-Secure-Email-Gateway directory:

`cd Hermes-Secure-Email-Gateway/`

Run the script as root:

`bash ubuntu_hermes_1804_install.sh`
